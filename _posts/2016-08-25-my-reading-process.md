intro: I read a lot. I didn’t until just a few years ago but I do now. An unexplainable shift of mind happened in my head in 2012. I have no idea where it came from but I wrote about it before. I take reading so seriously now that I designed a systematic process for it.

## Reading Books
First of all, I keep a [to-read list on Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11006629-matej-latin-latin). Whenever I encounter a book that I find interesting, I add it to this list (more than 400 items at the moment). Besides reading I also like to plan. I use Trello for all my planning. I split every year into quarters—periods of three months. Then I write down all the books that I want to read in the upcoming period and create a checklist. With a goal of 40 books per year that’s 10 books per quarter.

Then comes the actual reading of the book. I always keep a pencil with me—when reading a book in physical form—to make notes. Simple underlining and marking with an exclamation mark does the trick. I never write actual notes. I may, sometimes, add small page indicator stickers to the page where I make a note. This way I can come back to it in just a few seconds. I tend to do that only with technical and detailed books. Especially the ones I know I’ll be coming back to in the future.

## Reading Articles
There’s so much content on the web. It’s hard to keep up with it and even daunting at times. I’m signed up to a few newsletters, some weekly, some daily. That’s where I find most of the content that I want to read online. I want reliable, high-quality content. So far, curated newsletters were the only ones that met my criteria. I tend to open a link from Twitter every now and then but I always take those with a pinch of salt.

Anyway, whatever I find interesting goes to my to-read list. This one I keep at Instapaper. I never read these articles right after finding them. They always go to this list and I read them when I have time. Unlike for books, I don’t have a designated time for reading articles. It takes me 5–10 minutes to read most of them so they’re great for quick reads during snack time or something similar. I archive all the articles I read so the to-read list stays clean (kinda makes me feel good to have an almost empty to-read list).

## Weekly Reading Review
I used to write book reviews. A short recap with a simple goal. Go through the book again and review my own notes and underlinings. I learned much more from a book this way than just reading it once. I would then publish these reviews on my website. The process was too long and because of that it failed its purpose. So I decided to keep doing that but keep these notes private. This way I can keep them quick and dirty but just enough so I can get back to them later.

I now do this in my “weekly reading review”—whenever I actually have time to have one. I sit down, take a look at the book and articles that I read that week. I focus on my notes and write a short recap. The recap is not even made of actual sentences. Bullet lists mostly. But it’s enough for me to be able to get back and just enough so what I read actually sticks in my mind.

I found this systematic process of reading to work well for me. Am I taking it too far? Do you have a similar approach to reading? Share your thoughts with me.
