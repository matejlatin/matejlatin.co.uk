I launched an email course called Better Web Type on 14 February this year. It introduces the topic of typography to people who actually design and build websites—web designers and web developers. Split into 10 daily lessons, it covers topics like rhythm in web typography, how to use modular scales, how to combine typefaces and similar. It was featured in [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/), as a cover feature in the Net magazine, in the Web Designer magazine, as well as sites like [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-295/) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/web-development-reading-list-186/). The course is highly-rated with an average of 4.7 out of 5 after more than 700 reviews.

The students that went through the course loved it so much that they started asking for a book. Writing a book on the same topic was always on my roadmap but the high demand turned it into my top priority. The book will be released as an eBook on July 31 and as a paperback shortly after. It’s currently available to [order at Better Web Type](https://betterwebtype.com/book).
