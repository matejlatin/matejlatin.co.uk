title:  Design, minimalism & typography
intro:  My name is Matej [mʌt-eɪ]. My story began in a small seaside town in Slovenia. Aged 13, I joined an after-school class where I handcrafted my first website and it changed my life. It made me who I am today&hairsp;—&hairsp;it made me a designer.

My passion for simple, clean & usable design took me to a journey through Germany, Luxembourg and dropped me off in London, UK — where I currently work as a Lead UX/UI Designer at Auto Trader.

I spend my free time working on personal side projects and create things like [Better Web Type](https://betterwebtype.com), [Gutenberg—A Meaningful Web Typography Starter Kit](http://matejlatin.github.io/Gutenberg/) and [Quotes on Type](http://quotesontype.com).
