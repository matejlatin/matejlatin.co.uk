      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2021/10/13/i-need-a-break/">&lt;p&gt;It’s almost one year since I “broke down” and I have been struggling ever since. A good week is always followed by two or three bad ones. It’s exhausting. So I decided to take a break. Or at least try. Me and my family depend on my full-time job so I can’t just stop working. But I need to take a pause and find a new balance. And that means stopping the work on my personal projects for a while. I’ve been running my business on the side for almost 5 years but even before that, I had always worked on personal side projects. There were times where I would regularly work for 13 hours a day. And there were already times where I broke down in a way and had to pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running the &lt;em&gt;Better Web Type&lt;/em&gt; website, my new online course &lt;em&gt;UX Buddy&lt;/em&gt; and balancing it with my full-time job and private life just isn’t possible any more. We’re also finishing building our house which we hope we’ll move into in December. So all together, it’s too much to handle right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m taking a break from personal projects. I don’t know for how long but at least until we finish the house. I already stopped sending the monthly Better Web Type newsletter simply because I had no energy to keep it up. I also got a bit tired of doing the same thing over and over again. So when the newsletter comes back, I’ll probably explore how I could include more diverse content—so not just web typography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-still-to-come-in-2021&quot;&gt;Things still to come in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll still do another early release of my UX Buddy course in November. So if you’re unhappy at work and want to get a better UX design job, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxbuddy.co/&quot;&gt;check it out and join the waitlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also do a couple more discount sales for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-book/&quot;&gt;Better Web Type book&lt;/a&gt; about which I’ll notify everyone on my mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, I hope to get some rest in the months ahead. See you in 2022!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my latest personal project launched, I finally have some time to reflect on the books I read in 2020. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/11006629&quot;&gt;I only managed to read 19 books&lt;/a&gt; in the past year. I say “only” because my goals is to read 25 per year. This is a list of books that I &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; in 2020, they weren’t necessarily published in 2020. They’re not sorted in any order, I just really liked these four books. This is the fourth year that I’m writing such post. You can see my favourite books from the past years here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lab-rats&quot;&gt;Lab Rats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1568031789l/52932046._SX318_SY475_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lab Rats by Dan Lyons&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lab Rats by Dan Lyons &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became a fan of Dan Lyons after reading his book Disrupted which made it to the list of my favourite books of 2018. His writing and his voice really resonates with me. I love that he covers controversial topics and isn’t afraid to attack commonly accepted “norms.” This time, he looks at the Silicon Valley companies and how they’re destroying the workplace but selling it to us as “it’s the hip thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-plan offices are so cool right? Everyone works with everyone else in the company and collaboration drastically improves because of that. It also promotes transparency because there are &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; no walls. Employees in such offices feel like they’re part of a cool company that “gets” what’s hip and cool. So they redesigned the offices into an open-plan layout to make the employees feel more engaged working for such a cool company. What a load of bullshit! &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2019/02/01/open-plan-offices-are-the-sweatshops-of-the-west/&quot;&gt;Open-plan offices are the modern-day sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;. That’s it! They’re not designed to make the employees feel better or work better, they’re designed to fill in as many people as possible and thus reduce the cost per employee. This is just one of the things that Lyons attacks. The others are the greed, the new tech oligarchs, the dehumanisation of workers and many others. Highly recommended if you work for a tech company that tries to emulate the bullshit that the tech giants have been pushing down our throats for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t agree with everything that Lyons attacks in this book. For example, I believe that the Lean methodology does help reduce waste at tech companies. But his main point is that instead of our workplace improving through decades, it’s actually getting worse. We work more than the past generations but we get paid less. We can’t even dream about retiring and receiving a pension. All the progress in automation and robotics has had little impact on improving people’s work and lives. Something’s terribly wrong and we need to fix it. Thankfully, Lyons offers ideas and examples of how certain companies try to do the opposite and have a positive impact on the world, without exhausting their employees and without being driven by greed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outliers&quot;&gt;Outliers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was the year when I first read a book by Malcolm Gladwell. I heard many good things about him and his books but just never took the time to actually get and read one. This changed one day when I decided to go to a local bookshop and see if I can find an interesting book. It’s something I love to do as I then always remember the experience of finding and buying the book and all the excitement that comes with that. Interestingly, this wasn’t the first book of his that I read. The first one that truly caught my eye was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22433143-david-and-goliath&quot;&gt;David and Goliath&lt;/a&gt;. Although I thoroughly enjoyed it, Outliers stuck with me more. Both are excellent though, I just didn’t want to include two books of the same author on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-1&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gladwell seriously knows how to write. Holy shit! I don’t know what exactly it is about his writing but it’s so easy an enjoyable. Reading his books makes you want to keep going. Even when you read the chapter that you wanted to read in a day, you can’t wait to get to the next one. I always read his books so quickly just because of that. I generally tend to read for about 30 minutes each day. But when I was reading his books, I ended up reading for one hour, sometimes even longer. He does a masterful job of telling stories that don’t seem related at first. Then, in the end, his wraps it all together and hits you with a punch you didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-1&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I loved about this book the most is the message itself. He starts going through different stories about people and how they became really good at something. Stories of outliers. Something that seems to tie the stories together as you read, is how he always comes to the conclusion that outliers become outliers because of many different factors. Some are internal (people’s motivations), others external (opportunities). In the end, he concludes the book with his story and wraps it all together in an emotional way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outliers aren’t outliers because of one singular reason. They’re outliers because of their past, their family’s past, the people that surround them and the opportunities that they had. In a way, they’re not outliers at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-conquest-of-happiness&quot;&gt;The Conquest of Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1495532262l/16234597.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Conquest of Happiness by Bertrand Russel&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Conquest of Happiness by Bertrand Russel &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had this book on my to-read list for a long time. It’s a highly rated book and the topic of happiness which has always attracted me. That’s because I’ve been witnessing people being miserable their whole lives and not doing anything about that. I always thought &lt;em&gt;that’s so strange, why don’t they try to solve the problems that seem to be making their lives a misery?&lt;/em&gt; I guess that’s a bit naive now when I look back. Especially because not every problem can be solved, or maybe it can’t be solved easily. So yes, people turn to easy solutions like ignoring their problems, drinking and generally destructive behaviour. First published in 1930, this book talks about all that. Russell is actually most well-known for being a genius mathematician, but he was also a historian, a philosopher and a rationalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-2&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell starts out with listing things that make people unhappy including &lt;em&gt;competition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;boredom and excitement&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;envy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the sense of sin&lt;/em&gt; and others. It was interesting to read his thoughts about these things and recognise how they make me or other people unhappy. The topic about competition stuck with me the most. Why are people so competitive? Why does everyone want more money? Why does everything need to be bigger and stronger than everyone else’s? Why do we sacrifice so much to become “successful?” Here’s a line that I underlined and want to keep in my mind at all times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Success can only be one ingredient in happiness, and is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then explores things that make people happy and lists &lt;em&gt;zest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;affection&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; as the main things. Interestingly, success, money and the things that people usually chase aren’t on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-2&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop competing with everyone else, find a good balance between boredom and excitement, don’t work too much, don’t be envious, get rid of the sense of sin, stop caring about what others think. Approach life with zest, dedicate your time to your work, your family and your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally don’t read fiction books. In a way, I always felt like “I don’t have time for such books”, meaning that there’s little to be learned from them. Well, my wife recommended this one and I realised how wrong I was. How silly of me to assume that there’s nothing to be learned from stories, even if they’re made up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-3&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backman is a Swedish writer and this is a story about a grumpy old man. I don’t want to share too much about the story because I could easily spoil it for you. The coolest thing about it is that it drops you into the life of Ove at a certain point and it unravels what’s going on piece by piece. Sometimes it switched into what happened in the past when Ove was a child or a young man to give more background on why he is the way he is. He might seem like a typical annoying old man at first, but your heart warms up towards him as you read the story. Daily Mail described it as “Warm, funny, and unbearably moving”, and I think they nailed it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-3&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing that stuck with me the most from this book is: every person needs to have principles to navigate through life. But times changes and our principles need to be flexible. We may need to update, or even abandon some of them as we progress through our lives. I read this book in a hard period of my life and it really touched me. It got me back into reading fiction, mostly because it’s a story that a man can relate to. Sadly, there are too few stories like these out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not everything in 2020 was shit. I read more than enough good books to consider for this list. Out of 19 I read in total, I narrowed them down to seven and then further to four. They’re just four, but they’re really good. I hope this gives you a couple of ideas on what to read next and that you’ll enjoy whatever you pick.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2020/12/01/why-i-decided-to-sell-my-book-on-lulu/">&lt;p&gt;Going to a bookshop is a magical experience. Book prices are even higher there, I know, but there’s a magical feeling when you walk out with a new book in your hands. I can recollect most of such moments from the past, the one when I bought Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport in Edinburgh is the most memorable. It turned out to be the last book that I bought there before moving back to Slovenia so it’s a bittersweet memory. That’s what makes it even more special. Unlike an eBook, a physical book is an object that can be admired. It’s tangible, you open it up and it has a gentle smell no matter if it’s new or old. The smell changes as the book ages, but it’s always a lovely smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/digital-minimalism.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism turned out to be the last book I bought in my favourite bookshop in Edinburgh.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism turned out to be the last book I bought in my favourite bookshop in Edinburgh. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an author’s perspective, a book feels more real when you hold it in your hand and think “I made this.” That and my love for printed books is why I always wanted to create a printed version of my book about web typography. It’s so much harder than creating an eBook where you focus on the content. For a printed book to look good you need to pick the right material and the right finish for the cover and the pages. You need to think about page numbering, and footers, and headers, how to fit illustrations on a limited size of a page and how to optimise the number of pages. My book originally had more than 250 pages and I gradually reduced it to 232. Not by taking the content away but with better illustration placement and optimising margins and font sizes. You don’t need to do any of these things for the eBook!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-quality-of-the-materials-reflects-the-quality-of-the-book&quot;&gt;The quality of the materials reflects the quality of the book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent two whole months working on the second edition of my book at the beginning of 2018. Most of those two months went into improving the printed book. After that, I had to decide who my printer would be. I had experimented with Amazon’s print on demand, as well as Blurb’s. Both kinda sucked. Amazon’s print quality was poor. The cover looked cheap and so did the paper used for the interior pages. After investing so much time in making the book, I didn’t want it to look and feel cheap. I wanted the quality of the print to reflect the effort I put in making the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blurb was a bit better, so the very first printed books that I sold were printed in batches through Blurb and distributed manually. By that, I mean that I was carrying a huge box of around 50 books to the post office every week. When I lived in Camden, this meant a 30-minute walk with a box that weighed around 25 kg! I couldn’t keep up with it, I needed a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The second and improved quality edition of my web typography book printed by Lulu. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I did more research, I discovered Lulu. There, I was able to choose between a glossy and matte finish for the book cover. I chose matte. I could also choose the finish for the interior pages and I chose the coated one. I ordered a couple of test copies and was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. The matte cover finish had a velvety feel to it. It looked and felt sophisticated. The pages were slightly glossy because of the coating and it made the colours stand out. I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-distribution&quot;&gt;The distribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manual distribution turned out to be a huge endeavour. I had no idea that so many people wanted to buy the printed version of my book. Even the customers who already bought the eBook were ordering the printed version. There was a huge demand for it and I couldn’t keep up. A book would sometimes get lost during the delivery and I had to arrange a replacement. Two or three out of 100 books that I sent out would get lost. It’s not a lot, but it becomes significant when you’re running your business as a side gig. So when I reintroduced the printed version of the book this autumn, I decided to sell it directly through Lulu’s web platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;benefits-of-lulucom&quot;&gt;Benefits of Lulu.com&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lulu is print on demand which means that when a customer places an order, it will be directed to the print shop that is closest to that customer. They print the book and send it. The costs of shipping are lower and the delivery time shorter which results in more happy customers. If something goes wrong with the delivery the customer reaches out to Lulu and they take care of the problem. Their customer support is a bit slow but good. Now I have more time to focus on creating new things because Lulu takes care of the whole process. I can continue to offer the printed version of my book and I’m happy with the quality of the print and so were the customers that ordered the book so far.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Going to a bookshop is a magical experience. Book prices are even higher there, I know, but there’s a magical feeling when you walk out with a new book in your hands. I can recollect most of such moments from the past, the one when I bought Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport in Edinburgh is the most memorable. It turned out to be the last book that I bought there before moving back to Slovenia so it’s a bittersweet memory. That’s what makes it even more special. Unlike an eBook, a physical book is an object that can be admired. It’s tangible, you open it up and it has a gentle smell no matter if it’s new or old. The smell changes as the book ages, but it’s always a lovely smell.</summary>

      <title type="html">Why I don’t do Black Friday sales</title>

      <published>2020-11-28T20:56:54+01:00</published>
      <updated>2020-11-28T20:56:54+01:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2020/11/28/why-i-dont-do-black-friday-sales</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2020/11/28/why-i-dont-do-black-friday-sales/">&lt;p&gt;Black Friday is often referred to as the “consumerism holiday” and I can’t help myself but this sounds so wrong to me. The level of consumerism that we got to in the world today is absurd. Maybe I think that because of my minimalist mentality and lifestyle. Minimalism is something that has attracted me for years now and it became a fundamental part of my life. This doesn’t mean that I never buy anything on Black Friday sales, I do. But it’s usually something that I have been thinking about buying for a while. When you adopt the minimalist mentality, a buying decision is never an impulsive one. I think 10 times whether I really need something before I buy it. This is the complete opposite of what the whole Black Friday thing promotes and what it means to most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a huge misalignment between what Black Friday represents and my lifestyle. I would like that people who buy my book make a rational decision when they do so. I don’t want it to be an impulsive purchase only because it costs $5 instead of $50. If you think you need to learn about web typography and my book looks like something that’ll help with that, go ahead and buy it. Don’t buy it because there’s a huge discount and you found it in a &lt;em&gt;Best Black Friday deals for designers&lt;/em&gt; blog post. And in the end, you never actually read it. Or worse, you never even &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; reading it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/better-web-type-book-cover-paperback.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The second edition of my typography book called Better Web Typography for a Better Web.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The second edition of my typography book called Better Web Typography for a Better Web. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why I don’t do Black Friday sales is that I discount the book every month when I send out my web typography newsletter. The discount is significant but not absurd. It’s usually around 30%. An absurd discount like 90% can also make people question the quality of the product. I don’t want that. I invested a lot of time into writing and illustrating it and I want my customers to recognise that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t afford your book, &lt;br /&gt;can I get an extra discount?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Someone&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I receive a different email. Someone will write to me asking for an extra discount because they live in a country where a price tag of $20 represents their weekly earnings. I don’t give them more discount. If the person writing to me is sincere, I send them the book for free. It happened many times in the past and I intend to continue doing this. I didn’t write my book with intentions that people generally have when they write books—fortune, fame and recognition. I wrote it so that other designers could learn about typography faster and better than I did. The fact that it brings me some extra cash is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you live in a country where $20 is a ton of money, let me know. We’ll see what we can do. But if you don’t, know that when you buy the book it helps support my work and one day I’ll be able to dedicate more time to it. This way I’ll be able to reach and help out even more designers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2020/01/18/my-favourite-books-of-2019/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My favourite books of 2019" />

      <updated>2020-01-18T20:56:54+01:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2020/01/18/my-favourite-books-of-2019</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2020/01/18/my-favourite-books-of-2019/">&lt;figure class=&quot;full-bleed-image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fav-books-2019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to my Goodreads’ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019&quot;&gt;My Year in Books 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; report, I read 24 books last year. That’s five more than the year before but still one short from reaching my goal of 25. I guess I’m slowly getting there. This is a list of my favourite books that I &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, not of books that were published in 2019 (although some of them were). And they’re not sorted in any order at all, the same as my lists for &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2017/12/22/my-favourite-books-of-2017/&quot;&gt;my favourite books of 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2019/01/18/my-favourite-books-of-2018/&quot;&gt;my favourite books of 2018&lt;/a&gt; weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;company-of-one&quot;&gt;Company of One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1534280579l/41144788._SY475_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Company of One by Paul Jarvis&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Company of One by Paul Jarvis &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the very first book that I read in 2019 as it was released in January and I preordered it. I’ve been following Paul Jarvis for a long time as he’s been an inspiration ever since I stumbled upon him. This is his first book ever but I always liked his writing style and honesty. I’ve also been exploring the entrepreneurship waters for the last few years so I wanted to see what Jarvis’ approach is. Maybe there’s something cool to learn from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, of course, there was. Jarvis challenges the whole ever-growing business that we, as a society, are fans of. You know, the stories about the Facebooks and similar companies. How one geek created an app and became an overnight success because of their genius idea. Jarvis takes the opposite approach. He “only” has his own small company where it’s just him. He does collaborate with a small number of other people that he trusts but he intentionally remained a company of one. He argues that a company should continually be made better instead of bigger and makes a compelling case where he prioritises &lt;em&gt;a rich life over the riches&lt;/em&gt;, as Cal Newport wrote in his review of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first book that came to my mind when I was preparing this list and it’s for one sole reason. It fundamentally changed my view of entrepreneurship. Since I read this book, I started shaping my own business strategy that aligns with a lot of what Jarvis argues for. I realise that often, entrepreneurs feed their egos with their business “successes” which are often measured by the size of the company and its revenue. I want to take the opposite approach now. I want to have my own business to help me fulfil my purpose: support my family and live a modest but happy life with meaningful relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight img-border&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1578318088l/44160076._SX318_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned Cal Newport and his opinion of Paul Jarvis’ book, let’s take a look at his &lt;em&gt;Digital Minimalism&lt;/em&gt; next. I’ve been a fan of Newport’s ideas ever since I read his book Deep Work (which made it to my list of favs in 2018). Digital Minimalism was his latest and brand new book when I bought it in the busiest bookshop in Edinburgh that I persistently visited almost every week. One of the coolest things about buying a physical book is the recollection of the shopping experience—in my case, it turned out to be the last book that I bought in my favourite bookshop before I left Edinburgh to move back to Slovenia. It’s a bittersweet memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-1&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual for Newport, he presents the problem he’s writing about in a clear way. In this case, it’s the society’s relationship with everything digital, but especially social media. It’s coming to the point where billions of people are building unhealthy habits that lead to lives cluttered with junk, instead of meaningful relationships. In the second part, he gives advice on how to move away from that and he doesn’t stray away from his usual actionable approach. That’s what I like about him the most—he presents practical things that one should do to solve their problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-1&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newport leans heavily on Henry David Thoreau’s ideas from Walden. I think that the following quote he included describes his book well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of a thing is the amount of what I call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Henry David Thoreau&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this in practice, I was never attracted by the idea of owning an Apple Watch because of exactly this way of thinking. It’s another item in my life that would constantly call for my attention, that I’d need to manage so it doesn’t overwhelm me and so on. So I would need to trade moments of my life to spend with yet another device. I didn’t want that. My iPhone alone is a distraction so tempting that it nearly turned me into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2018/08/27/buzz-junkie/&quot;&gt;buzz junkie&lt;/a&gt;, so I need to manage it rigidly to prevent it from sucking my life away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quiet&quot;&gt;Quiet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547203165l/17204619._SY475_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quiet by Susan Cain&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Quiet by Susan Cain &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a book that my wife bought but it was also on my “to-read” list. I know for a while now that I’m an introverted person so I wanted to learn more about this characteristic that is sometimes seen as a “disability” preventing some to act as “normal” people in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-2&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/articles/2016/07/07/a-tale-of-a-colour-blind-designer/&quot;&gt;my colour blindness&lt;/a&gt;, being an introvert can be used as a superpower. But I didn’t realise this until I read this book. Susan Cain challenges the ever-likeable extroverted fella as being the only acceptable norm. Being introverted simply means that a person likes to be on their own sometimes, in order to “process” their thoughts and emotions. It’s like a time to recharge for them. It’s the exact opposite of how extroverts are, who feed on the energy of others—they simply need to constantly engage with other people in some form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-2&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout her book, Cain presents the extroverts and introverts as polar opposites, but as opposites that need to work well together. It’s the balance of the two types of personalities that brings out the best from each of them. But at the same time, she gives a voice to all the introverted people and presents us exactly how we are. We prefer to listen more and talk less, we hate small talk but enjoy deep discussions, we dislike conflict. And that’s perfectly fine. Just because being an introvert is being a part of a minority it doesn’t mean that we should all act as extroverts, just because it’s the social norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;originals&quot;&gt;Originals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1534874989l/31341887._SY475_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Originals by Adam Grant&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Originals by Adam Grant &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book got my attention because of its attractive cover, I must admit. Then, one day, I saw Adam Grant’s Ted Talk and found it insightful. I’d recognised that I had his book on my “to-read” list for a while so I decided to finally read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-3&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m glad I did. Grant’s writing is simple but compelling. He backs his arguments with research and tells awesome stories at the same time. His book includes examples of Steve Jobs’ and other’s famous entrepreneurs’ greatest failure when they invested into Segway, why the TV show Seinfeld almost didn’t make it and how he himself failed to invest into a company that seemed to be doomed but turned out to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-3&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant argues that in order to be original you need to be involved with many different things (read: hobbies), you need to produce huge amounts of work, you don’t need to be the first to come up with an idea (known as first mover’s advantage) and also that collaboration is overrated. His book drives to insightful conclusions and actionable things a reader can do to be more “original”. But at the same time: our originality needs to be presented to others in a way that they find acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it’s not original enough, it’s boring or trite. If it’s too original, it may be hard for the audience to understand. The goal is to push the envelope, not tear the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rest&quot;&gt;Rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight img-border&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525183689l/36342157.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rest by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rest by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is one of my favourite topics. Cal Newport already mentioned the importance of rest in his book &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt; but didn’t go into details. I’m really glad that Alex Soojung-Kim Pang did. Knowing what I did from Newport’s ideas, I felt attracted to the subtitle of Pang’s book when I saw it in a bookshop: &lt;em&gt;Why you get more done when you work less.&lt;/em&gt; It sounds counter-intuitive, I know, but as I was already familiar with the concept, I wanted to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-4&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s my favourite style of writing—a combination of story-telling and backed by research. I loved it because it touches on the other great problem I think we have as a society—working too hard. I experienced working 13 hours a day when I freelanced alongside my full-time job. I had no hobbies, didn’t work on anything out of my own interest so my life was boring and meaningless. Unfortunately, this description would fit the lives of millions of people around the world. Overworking is becoming the norm. Pang puts it perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s leaders treat stress and overwork as a badge of honour, brag about how little they sleep and how few vacation days they take…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-take-away&quot;&gt;Key take away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pang argues that &lt;em&gt;when we stop and rest properly, we’re not paying tax on creativity, we’re investing in it.&lt;/em&gt; He presents work and rest as two sides of the same coin and argues that they need to be in balance. But by “rest” he doesn’t mean lying on the couch doing nothing (although even this form of rest is needed sometimes), he advocates for an active approach of spending free time. But first of all, we need to reshape our lives so that we actually have some free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your work is your self, when you cease to work, you cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Alex Soojung-Kim Pang&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on and describes (and backs with research) how working fewer hours per day, having a morning routine, taking walks and naps as well as sleeping well stimulates our creativity. I adopted some of the things he suggests in the book and found that they had a profoundly positive impact on my life. Years ago, I used to burn out every couple of months, now I’m able to sustain high productivity and efficiency by resting more and working less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36342157-rest&quot;&gt;Rest on Goodreads →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for 2019. My favourite five books and how they shaped me and my life. I hope this post gives you a couple of ideas for what to read next, maybe you’ll benefit from these books as much as I did. I certainly hope so.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2019/10/16/would-you-do-your-job-for-free/">&lt;p&gt;I remember telling this to the CEO of the first company that hired me as a full-time UX designer: “thanks for the raise but it really isn’t about money for me. If I could, I’d do this for free.” They were really happy with my performance so they gave me a raise just a couple of months after I started working there. Until then, I had a full-time, non-designer job which I hated and I freelanced doing design work on the side. Being able to do it full-time literally was a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remembered this a few days ago. That moment was fundamental because I realised I really did love being a designer. But there’s another part to happiness at work that’s equally important—to love working for the company you work for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/search.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finding the right company to work for is as hard as finding a life partner.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Finding the right company to work for is as hard as finding a life partner. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you launched a product with a subscription of $10 per month. It’s just you who works on the product so you don’t need to share your profits with anyone. You own the house you live in and you only need to cover your costs of living—food and utility bills. Let’s say that the total of your costs of living is $1,000 per month. In two months, 1,000 people sign up for your product. Your costs of running the product are marginal (server/hosting and other smaller fees). This means you’re getting $10,000 in every month and only $1,000 out. You have a profit of around $9,000 per month. That’s more than $100,000 per year and should be more than enough to support a normal lifestyle for a typical family. &lt;em&gt;Would you keep your job?&lt;/em&gt; If no, &lt;em&gt;would you still contribute to the solution your company works on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loving what you do and the company you work for leads to meaningful work which leads to personal fulfilment.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to the first question, you probably love doing what you do. It’s not so much about the money it brings, it’s more about the happiness it brings you while you work on the things you want to work on. If you answered “no”, then the opposite is probably true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to the second question, then that probably means that you also love working for the company you’re working for. This is the hardest part in working for others—it’s hard to find a company that aligns with your values and goals. You may enjoy being a designer but you don’t truly love working for the company that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I love being a designer, it’s all I ever wanted to be. I love it so much that I can’t simply stop working at 5pm. But working for my employer for more than 8 hours a day would hurt my productivity and would also be against my values. So I work on my personal projects. Again, it’s not because I have to work on them but because I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for GitLab—an all-remote company with values that aren’t just a couple of words on a website. It’s a company that grew from an OpenSource project and established its values as it went. They aren’t something that a bunch of clueless directors came up with on an off-site event. That, combined with the fact that these values are well-aligned with what I look for from an employer, makes me think that I’d continue contributing to GitLab even if I left the company someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ux-buddy&quot;&gt;UX Buddy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to put in words how glad I am to have found something I love doing in my life and a company that I love working for. It’s been a tough journey, one of the ups and downs and learning from my mistakes, but it eventually led me to where I wanted to get. I can’t really help others with the first question (do you love doing what you do?), but I can help with the second one. So if you love being a designer but don’t really love working for the company you’re working for, my latest side project might be for you. It’s called UX Buddy and it’s about helping UX and product designers find a better job. A job where they don’t just push pixels, where they don’t just do things they’re told, but actually get to collaborate with others and help drive the company towards solving user problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m doing an early launch for people on my mailing list who can get the course for half price, with a chance of a &lt;em&gt;total 75% discount&lt;/em&gt; 😲 If you love being a designer but don’t love the company you work for or the work you do for them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxbuddy.co&quot;&gt;check the UX Buddy course out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2019/02/01/open-plan-offices-are-the-sweatshops-of-the-west</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2019/02/01/open-plan-offices-are-the-sweatshops-of-the-west/">&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I joined a tiny startup and it was the first time I experienced an open-plan office. There were only three other people working with me in that office and we really got along. We went to lunch together, took walks together, hung out in our free time and built a friendly relationship based on trust. My journey would then take me forward to London where I’d end up working for other, larger startups. Little did I know, that the tiny Luxembourgish company would be the only positive onsite working environment that I’d get to experience in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No nesting!”, I’m told. I’m expected to move around, sit in different areas each day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;force-indent&quot;&gt;
After working for a medium-sized startup in London I went on to work for an enterprise. The office was the most stylish compared to the previous ones, it was larger and in a recently-built skyscraper just the opposite of the Google headquarters. Beautiful views of downtown London on one side, similar skyscrapers on the other. Long rows of tables everywhere and busy-looking people slouching over their laptops. Lively and even somewhat noisy, but, surprisingly, it all looked strangely bleak. I learned on the first day that the company practices what they call “a clean desk policy”. This simply means that at the end of the day you need to pack your shit up, put it in a box and take it to your little American-high-school-looking locker. “No nesting!”, I’m told. I’m expected to move around, sit in different areas each day. It’s supposed to make me interact with different people in the company.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-plan-offices-done-wrong&quot;&gt;Open-plan offices done wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations like these try to emulate the startup working environment by creating such open offices where they throw 100 people in and tell them to collaborate. They expect cross-pollination of ideas like we’re fucking bees or something. It’s not that simple. It kinda works for startups because the teams are usually really small. We’re talking about 5 to 7 people. Collaborating in an open-plan office is great when everyone is working on the same thing, when you’re all on the same mission, when you hang out with them during lunch time, go home together… But when you share your space with people who work on different things (sometimes even in different departments) that constantly distract you with their noisiness &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; nosiness it’s a completely different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;full-bleed-image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/open-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A typical open-plan office. Endless rows of desks, people slouching over laptops with zero privacy and maximum distractions.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A typical open-plan office. Endless rows of desks, people slouching over laptops with zero privacy and maximum distractions. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/QBpZGqEMsKg&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what large companies that try to emulate startups get wrong the most. And the worst thing about it is that they &lt;em&gt;don’t even realise that they’re not getting it&lt;/em&gt;. They just brag about their “&lt;em&gt;cool office&lt;/em&gt;” and how “&lt;em&gt;we’re all about collaboration&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;flat hierarchy&lt;/em&gt;”. They think that a cool office will create a great culture. That cleaning up your own desk everyday will force you to sit with Jeff from the sales department and get friendly with him to eventually share ideas and interests. Well, let me tell you something: Jeff is fucking annoying and I, as an introverted designer, have absolutely nothing in common with him. He’s nothing but a huge distraction to me. I can still hear him yap around on his call even through my headphones playing the loudest Death Metal music I can find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collaboration-kills-creativity&quot;&gt;Collaboration kills creativity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting study called &lt;em&gt;Coding War Games&lt;/em&gt; conducted by Tom Demarco which compared 600 computer programmers at 92 companies. Long story short, they found:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;that people from the same companies performed at roughly the same level — but that there was an enormous performance gap between organizations. What distinguished programmers at the top-performing companies wasn’t greater experience or better pay. It was how much privacy, personal workspace and freedom from interruption they enjoyed. &lt;em&gt;Sixty-two percent of the best performers said their workspace was sufficiently private compared with only 19 percent of the worst performers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There it is: &lt;em&gt;privacy, personal workspace&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;freedom from interruption&lt;/em&gt;. These are the things that make programmers produce better work, not experience or higher salary. But it seems most companies rather &lt;em&gt;spend&lt;/em&gt; money hiring highly experienced programmers, pay them high salaries and have them produce mediocre work because they want to &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; money on the office costs. Mindblowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to make the open-plan office work in larger companies would be to keep some walls between sections that divide the office into small working areas where people feel safe and, most of all, comfortable. To create small offices for teams of 5 to 7 people (who work on the same thing/project) where they can collaborate and work undisturbed. Some companies, including Facebook which was the largest advocate for open-plan offices, are starting to revert to something like that. I guess they finally figured out that open-plan offices don’t actually work. And there’s solid research to back that claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-plan-offices-simply-dont-work&quot;&gt;Open-plan offices simply don’t work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the open-plan offices is to encourage collaboration, increase transparency, improve efficiency, and establish a great working relationship between the workers. To quote one of the loudest advocates of open-plan offices, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We encourage people to stay out in the open because we believe in serendipity—and people walking by each other teaching new things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the small offices that are reserved for meetings and calls in these kinds of environments are usually surrounded by transparent walls. So even when you’re trying to isolate yourself a bit, everyone can still see you. I guess it’s all in the name of transparency. Collaboration, transparency, efficiency and friendship at work all sounds nice, but is there any research backing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s research alright, but it’s not backing the claims of the open-plan office advocates. In fact, it proves the opposite. Researches at Harvard found that after switching to an open-plan office:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overall, face-to-face time decreased by around 70 percent across the participating employees, on average, with email use increasing by between 22 percent and 50 percent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experienced this myself. I’ve seen people who were sitting opposite of each other communicating through chat messages. All day long. Interestingly, both were wearing noise-cancelling headphones. When I saw that, I felt that it was something that’s perfectly fine to do and adopted it. Another study found that:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…many workers in open offices are frustrated by distractions that lead to poorer work performance. Nearly half of the surveyed workers in open offices said the lack of sound privacy was a significant problem for them and more than 30 percent complained about the lack of visual privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…the loss of productivity due to noise distraction … was doubled in open-plan offices compared to private offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This answers &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I always felt so anxious in these types of offices. Being an introvert, I found it extremely hard to isolate myself in such noisy environments. Especially because they’re noisy in a bad way. It’s not the same as working in a coffee shop where everything blends into the background. And then here’s the final nail in the coffin for the open-plan offices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While employees feel like they’re part of a laid-back, innovative enterprise, the environment ultimately damages workers’ attention spans, productivity, creative thinking, and satisfaction.  Furthermore, a sense of privacy boosts job performance, while the opposite can cause feelings of helplessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so if research proves that open-plan offices don’t work, why are 80% of office working environments already open-plan? The amount of space per employee shrank from 50 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1970 to less than 20 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2010&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Switching to an open-plan office is a global trend. Why do companies increasingly keep switching to it if it doesn’t actually work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-sweatshops-of-the-west&quot;&gt;The new sweatshops of the west&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look with horror at the typical sweatshops in Asia that, whether we like it or not, produce most of the products we buy. Rooms, crowded with people (and sometimes children) with no private space, trying to focus in such distracting and sometimes hazardous environment. Trying their best to produce the amount of work that will guarantee them their daily wage. Bad lighting, poor quality of air, limited toilet time, limited breaks. In short, extremely poor and unacceptable working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But aren’t the open-plan offices similar? People sitting in rows of desks with very limited space, no privacy, trying their best but can’t focus because of the many distractions? Isn’t this similar to a sweatshop but with better working conditions? Yes, the offices look nice and stylish, there’s air conditioning, decent lighting and good-enough office equipment—most office workers don’t have access to ergonomic office equipment—but at closer inspection, it’s just a nicer sweatshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it from the employer’s perspective. An office in central London is extremely expensive. The best way to make use of it is to turn it into an open-plan office and fill it with as many people as possible. Give them perks to distract them from those feelings of unproductiveness, anxiousness and even helplessness, that research suggests they have. Sweatshops were a thing in the west one hundred years ago but it seems they’re making a come back only in a nicer, stylish form. Open-plan offices are nothing more than a sweatshop disguised as “environments that promote collaboration, transparency, [insert a bullshit corporate term here]…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sweatshop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Different time period, worse working conditions, but the concept is the same.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Different time period, worse working conditions, but the concept is the same.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey through all this led me to a simple conclusion. I was my best self, most productive and most sane when I worked from home. That’s why after 5 years of distracting environments, limited efficiency, anxiety, helplessness and lack of control, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2018/05/24/going-back-to-working-remotely/&quot;&gt;go back to working remotely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/11006629-matej-latin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;shelf=read&amp;amp;title=matej-latin&amp;amp;sort=date_read&amp;amp;order=d&quot;&gt;the 19 that I managed to read&lt;/a&gt; (exactly the same number as in 2017), here are my top 5.

&lt;p&gt;I received this book as a Christmas gift. It had been on my to-read list for a while but to be honest, the thing that attracted me the most about it was its cover. I know we shouldn’t &lt;a href=&quot;/personal-notes/2016/07/21/judging-books/&quot;&gt;judge books by their covers&lt;/a&gt; but I feel that as a designer, I’m even more susceptible to this. If I see a book with cool typography on its cover, I’ll check it out. That’s how this book got into my to-read list in the first place. I liked the cover, checked what it was about, found it interesting and added it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually don’t like to talk or write about politics. I find it very divisive. But every now and then, I do enjoy a book about it. This was one of them. I think my perception of this book was affected by The Rational Optimist which I had read just one month earlier. Rutger Bregman, the author, argues that despite the stupendous progress in the last two centuries (measured by life expectancy and per capita income) there hasn’t been a change in quality of life accompanying it. In fact, poverty is still a huge problem, so is our work-life balance. We work more to be able to afford less compared to the generations before ours. We were promised advent of robots would eliminate boring and repetitive jobs, reduce our weekly working hours and enable us to live fuller and happier lives. Instead, the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rutger, also explores relatively radical ideas like giving free money to everyone, reduce our working hours to 15-a-week and introduce basic income. His case is compelling as he provides research backing these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems we take the world around us for granted. Get up, commute to work, spend 8-10 hours in an uninspiring working environment, doing dull and boring work, only to spend another hour commuting back home, completely exhausted. I lived that life back in London and I did something about it. I think it’s time we start doing something about it collectively. Irrational exhaustion of human resources needs to stop and there are many ways to go about it (remote work which eliminates the need for commuting for example). But it seems we’re not ready yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Discontent”, said Oscar Wilde, “is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation”.&lt;br /&gt;
—Rutger Bregman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was discontent about my life when it was what everyone would regard as normal. &lt;a href=&quot;/personal-notes/2018/05/24/going-back-to-working-remotely/&quot;&gt;Going back to working remotely&lt;/a&gt; improved it drastically for me. But that may not be an option for everyone. And as long as the masses of workers don’t feel discontent about it, our qualities of life won’t improve on the nation-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the many books that I read about how our brains work in the decision-making process, Thinking Fast and Slow and How We Decide are two more. I read all three of them in 2018 but this one stood out the most. I think it must be the balance between the length of the content, the language used and the slick storytelling—something that the other two failed at. How We Decide was very well told and articulated through stories, while Thinking Fast and Slow was very condensed, with long chapters and sometimes seemingly unnecessary details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-1&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three tell a similar story: we make decisions that are based on rationality or our emotions. We like to think that we’re in control of our decisions but we’re not. Completely different parts of our brains activate when taking different kind of decisions. The emotional part is the fast-thinking and the rational is the slower. But the tricky part is that we need both: emotional fast-thinking based on past experiences and urges keeps us alive in unexpected situations, the rational slow-thinking part allows us to solve complex problems. Influence is based on numerous psychological research and gives concrete, real-life examples of how to make better decisions and how certain entities (corporations) abuse this knowledge and trick us into buying the more expensive product or buy even what we don’t really need because &lt;em&gt;there are only x items left&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-1&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not the rational beings we assume we are, and we’re easily tricked into doing things against our benefits on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was also on my to-read list for a while. I believe I added because someone recommended it but I never took the time to take a closer look and see what exactly it’s about. In April last year, I moved from London to Edinburgh and started working remotely for GitLab. I had worked remotely before but it was never a full-time position with a remote-only company. I didn’t know what exactly to expect but I knew I wanted to organise my working days better. Especially compared to my days back in London. I remembered of this book and decided to read it. I have been recommending it to all my remotely-working colleagues ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-2&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will depend on the type of person you are: you either like flexible working hours and work whenever you have time and “feel like it” or you need somewhat rigid frames to be productive. I’m the latter. If I don’t have structure, I waste time. I procrastinate, keep putting work off until it’s urgent. The worst thing is that in the end, I feel really bad about not being productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out there’s shallow work and then there’s deep work. Shallow work is when we’re busy working but keep switching between tasks, emails, Slack chat etc. We’re working, but we’re not productive. Deep work is the opposite. When we work deeply, we focus on one task, eliminate distractions and concentrate. Deep work is essential for any type of work creatives or technical people do (designers and developers). It’s really important to block out hours of time for deep work. Intervals of 2-3 hours work best. After reading this book, I reorganised my working days and also wrote &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2018/05/17/remote-work-eliminate-distractions-getting-things-done/&quot;&gt;Eliminating distractions and getting things done&lt;/a&gt;  to document my process and help others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-2&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocking out time, reserved for focus is essential for deep work. And deep work is the most productive and effective way to solve complex problems or produce slick solutions. Take a look at how you spend your time. Track it for a couple of days if necessary. This will give you a great overview and you’ll be able to find room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing. I don’t think I would ever read this book if it wasn’t on sale on Amazon for £0.95 and didn’t have a cool cover that attracted me immediately. I had no idea what to expect, I first thought it was a book about startups and how they disrupt markets with innovative products. It’s not. It’s about a journalist who loses his job as an editor of a popular magazine/website and joins a local startup. Reading this book felt like reading his journal about his experiences while working for this startup company—HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-3&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever worked for a startup with a “strong culture” and felt a bit weird or unfitting, you’ll identify with a lot of what Dan Lyons, the author, went through. He writes about typical startup bullshit: big promises that lead to disappointments, social pressures to fit in with “the culture” (or what I sometimes describe as “the cult”), the internal politics and about the coming to a realisation of what most of these startups are—money making machines  fuelled by hype. The more hype they manage to produce, the more millions the founders make. For most of these companies it’s not even about creating a useful product for the users, but more about “cashing in”. I went through similar experiences of trying to fit in with a “startup cult” and connected with the author on several points. &lt;em&gt;A hilarious and amusing read if you ever worked for a startup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-3&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup jobs are exciting. The possibility of joining a small but growing company with great potential is very tempting. The problem is that most of these startups turn into something resembling cults. You either fit in or not. And this will be the biggest factor in how successful your time with that company will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-daily-stoic&quot;&gt;The Daily stoic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1462161080l/29093292.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;By Ryan Holiday&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book that I started reading in August 2017. It’s a book with 366 meditations and the reader is supposed to read one each day. Some go on and read more but I believe they miss the point of the book. The point is to adopt the stoic mentality one step at a time. It works really well if you establish a routine of reading the daily thought regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-4&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that each book I read changes me. It changes me the way I think as well as how I see the world and my role in it. Sometimes reading a book is merely about learning something new. I think that this book has changed me most profoundly from all the books that I read. It helped me understand the anger that I used to have about pretty much everything. By understanding it and where it came from, I was able to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the thoughts in the book are from the writings by Seneca—a Roman stoic philosopher—and Marcus Aurelius—the Roman emperor. The main point of stoicism is to not worry about things that are outside of your control and focus on the things that you &lt;strong&gt;can control&lt;/strong&gt;. This book has helped me make decisions that I would never be able to make without realising that. I keep reading the meditations every day even though I already read the whole book. I think I’ll keep reading them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-take-away&quot;&gt;Key take away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhappiness in our lives is often triggered by the things outside of our control. This is especially true in our world driven by capitalism where we’re constantly pushed to be better than others, have more of everything and be perceived by everyone else as great and our lives as worthy of envy. If we’re content with what we have and not always yearn for more, we can actually achieve happiness. Unlike most things, our desires &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; under our control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Control your perceptions.&lt;br /&gt;
Direct your actions properly.&lt;br /&gt;
Willingly accept what’s outside your control.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s all we need to do.&lt;br /&gt;
—Ryan Holiday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple, but it takes conscious effort every day to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While there’s some value in seeing how candidates react to curve-ball questions, they don’t really add much to a 45-minute interview. We also won’t ask you to attend an all-day session with a series of interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/ux-designer/#hiring-process&quot;&gt;hiring process&lt;/a&gt; at GitLab is way simpler and more efficient. A successful candidate has to go through four stages of interviewing before receiving an offer. Altogether, we spend around 2-3 hours with them, so we need to ask the right questions to be efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so confident in the efficiency of these questions that I’m completely okay with sharing these publicly. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; you answer matters less than &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2018/08/27/buzz-junkie/">&lt;p&gt;It’s early in the morning, probably around 7 because it’s still quite dark outside. I’m reading a book and trying to relax a bit before another busy day, my phone is resting on the table not too far away from me, but still out of reach. The book is about stoicism and a lot of topics in it are about having control over our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Buzzz, buzzz!” The phone suddenly comes to life with vibrating sounds and light emitting from the screen that turns on. As it does, it slightly illuminates the dark room with its blueish glow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Guan &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wave of emotions hits me. Excitement, mixed with a bit of fear and anticipation—is it someone who needs my help? Someone from my subscribers telling me about their story? Is it someone sending me feedback about my book? I jump from my armchair and frantically rush to press the button to turn the screen back on. The moments seem like minutes before I finally get to see what the notifications is. It’s Twitter. “Rob White just liked a photo by Hung Lee…” What?! Who the fuck are these people and why the fuck should I care? You disturbed my morning routine, made me get up from the chair, destroyed my focus, made me feel anxious and interrupted me while reading the book and this is what I get in return?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What?! Who the fuck are these people and why the fuck should I&amp;nbsp;care?&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;force-indent&quot;&gt;
I used to take my phone everywhere with me—always in my side pocket. I would jump on it like a starved lion jumps on a fresh piece of meat whenever it buzzed. I would check in on it even when it didn’t buzz. Shit, sometimes I would even check it a couple of times in a single minute. I always expected something important and meaningful to show up on that screen but most of the time, the screen was either full of junk or worse—empty. When it was empty I would go on and unlock the phone and start checking in on every app that I commonly used. &lt;em&gt;There’s gotta be something there but the notification probably didn’t come through&lt;/em&gt;, is what I was thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been doing that for years and never saw anything wrong with it but then one day it hit me. I looked at myself from the third person. Jumping from whatever I was doing just to check the phone. Checking in even when it didn’t buzz. I was pathetic. Like a junkie, dependant on that dopamine rush but only to be let down every time. Like a mouse in an experiment not knowing what the sound brings, food or an electric shock. Like the people in casinos, putting the coins into the machine and pulling the lever always expecting that this time it will really be their time. This time they’ll hit the jackpot and become rich. But they never do. I wasn’t any better, I was a buzz junkie. Hooked to the meaninglessness of social media. How could I have been tricked into becoming such a fool? Why did I allow these corporations to come in and disrupt my personal life like that? Why did I allow to feel nervous and agitated all the time because of this shit? It brings no value to me. Absolutely zero. So why keep doing it? At that moment, I found it ironic that I had been reading a book about stoicism and having control over my life for almost a year but only realised that so late. I had very little control over my life and I needed to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;breaking-a-habit&quot;&gt;Breaking a habit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I did, I disabled all notifications except messages. I never had the Facebook app on my phone and now it was time to delete a few more. I always used the ‘Do not disturb’ mode that comes with iOS and set it from 10 pm to 7 am. I go to sleep at 10 in the evening and get up at 6 in the morning so that meant I only had one hour of distraction-free time. That’s crazy, why would I allow meaningless shit to agitate me right before I go to sleep? Why would I want to start my day with this meaningless shit? I changed the ‘Do not disturb’ mode to start at 8 pm and end at 9 am. Now nobody can disturb and agitate me two hours before I go to sleep and 3 hours after I wake up. This had a tremendous effect on not feeling anxious all the time. I feel more relaxed in general, I don’t look for meaningless distractions, I can focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel more relaxed in general, I don’t look for meaningless distractions, I can focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;force-indent&quot;&gt;
It took some time to get used to these changes. Occasionally, I still felt the urge to check on my phone and I had to make a conscious decision to stop myself from doing it. It &lt;em&gt;needs to be a&lt;/em&gt; conscious decision until we get used to it, it’s the only way to rewire our brain. I still get that urge sometimes when I glance at my phone lying somewhere, just waiting for me to turn the screen on and see what cool things it has in store for me. Most times I manage to resist the urge, sometimes I give in. It takes a long time to break a habit. But breaking a bad habit is liberating and worth the effort. I don’t feel as anxious and constantly agitated anymore. I feel I finally have peace of mind.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to feel sorry for people that are hooked on drugs… but aren’t we all hooked on something? It can be as innocent as sugar and coffee or something more destructive—cigarettes, social media… How do you use your phone?

I’m reading a book and trying to relax a bit before another busy day, my phone is resting on the table not too far away from me, but still out of reach. The book is about stoicism and a lot of topics in it are about having control over our lives.</summary>

    This is how my usual mornings went.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d get to the office at around 8:30 am—a bit early so I had some time to sort out my desk and check email. My first standup was at 9:20 am. This was the design standup which should have taken about 10 minutes but quite often extended to double its allocated time. I then had 20 minutes till the next standup at 10 am. This was the one that always started late and usually extended well over the allocated time. Right after that one, at 10:15 am was the next standup. This one usually took about 15 minutes to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article for Mind the Product and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/05/standups-suck-and-heres-how-to-fix-them/&quot;&gt;read the full story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2018/05/24/going-back-to-working-remotely</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2018/05/24/going-back-to-working-remotely/">&lt;p&gt;It’s a regular working day but I’m not sitting in an office, rushing from one meeting to another. Not anymore and it’s because I decided to go back to working remotely. I spent the last five years getting up really early, commuting to work, attending standups, hurrying to meetings and hoping that I would be able to get some work done before time runs out. It’s a never ending struggle. No matter how optimistic you are, the number of meetings never really reduces. Commuting to an office, even if it’s just a 20-minute walk, can never be pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we lived in Greenwich, which is one of the nicest areas in London, I had to get up at 5 in the morning. I’m one of those that like to have a strong morning routine. Before I would always get up at 6 just so that I had one hour that I could spend either reading or exercising (it’s something that helps me remain sane no matter how much stress there is in my life). But this was the first time that I had to commute to an office in central London and it took around one hour.  I didn’t want to let go of my routine so it had to be moved because of that. Do I have to tell you that I never really managed to stick to it? 5 in the morning was simply to early. I only had 7 hours of sleep (on good nights) and it simply wasn’t enough. In the end, living in a nice area meant nothing because I never had time or energy to explore and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-cog-in-a-machine&quot;&gt;A cog in a machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commuting, not enough sleep, not being productive at work… all these things meant that I had very little control over my life. By the time I got home I was completely spent, I had no energy to work on my personal projects. You don’t realise it at first but after a while, it hits you—you’re nothing but a cog in a machine. You show up, react to “emergencies”, but don’t stand out. If the cog doesn’t align well, the machine breaks down. And that’s exactly how it’s supposed to work—a cog’s job is not being extra productive, it’s fitting in and keep running things as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell are all these people doing? Sitting there, wasting their lives away…&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;force-indent&quot;&gt;
  I remember looking through the tall glass windows from the office that I used to work at. On one side, a gorgeous view of central London, dozens of similar glass buildings on the other. They were so close to ours that I could clearly see people sitting in rows of tables. I couldn’t help but think: “&lt;em&gt;what the hell are all these people doing? Sitting there, wasting their lives away….  Wait! Do they look at me and think the same thing? I’m sitting there, 8 hours every day with 100 other people distributed among the rows of desks.&lt;/em&gt;” We’re all like chickens—sitting in rows and laying eggs until one day when we stop being useful because our eggs aren’t good enough anymore. We all know what happens then.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years into it and I had enough. How the hell do people manage to do this for their whole lives? Fuck that, I don’t want to grow old and look back at all the things that could be but never were. All the years spent working my ass of but nothing to show for it. Something had to change and as it seems now, the solution was surprisingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-working-remotely-help&quot;&gt;How does working remotely help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had worked remotely before when I freelanced but it was never full-time. And it was never for a fully-remote company. The only difference in my routine is that now I actually manage to stick with it. I still get up early, exercise, read, get to work at the same time, have lunch at the same time and wrap up work at roughly the same time as well. Without commuting, I now have more energy to spend on actually working. In general, I have more time to spend with my family (my wife and our cat for now) and I also have enough energy to spend working on my own things in the evening—without burning out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No standups, few meetings and no need for my working hours to overlap with the colleagues from across the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;force-indent&quot;&gt;
  Working for a company like GitLab also helps a lot. Because we work on a tool that helps people collaborate asynchronously, we’re encouraged to work asynchronously ourselves. That means no standups, only few meetings and unlike most remote companies, no need for my working hours to overlap with the colleagues from across the ocean. The other day I washed my car in the morning and it wasn’t a problem even though it took me a couple of hours (believe it or not, I really enjoy washing my car 😅). I’m now in the coffee shop writing this post and I’ll go home shortly after and spend a few hours working and actually being productive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is something I had before but I never really appreciated it until I experienced the other side. I started this journey through Europe five years ago, looking for a collaborative and engaging office environment but found the exact opposite. I had to go through that to realise that what I was looking for was something that I already had in the first place. A brick and mortar office doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be in good company or productive. And it certainly doesn’t make work more enjoyable (in most cases it’s the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working remotely comes with its own set of challenges but can also give you a better control over your life. That’s something that really matters to me and that’s what ultimately lead me to make a decision to go back to working like this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/if-you-lived-here.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;If you lived here…&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;If you lived here… (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-flux.com/journal/09/61370/under-privileged-spaces-on-martha-rosler-s-if-you-lived-here-8230/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap, red bricks, tiny windows, wooden-fenced square gardens, every house is exactly the same as the one next to it. Wet soil from the morning rain as there’s no grass anywhere, it’s desolated with no signs of life at all. Just the grey clouds in the sky and the cold wind howling around the box-shaped houses. “Bleak” is the perfect word to describe it. I have no idea how much it costs but it must be a couple of hundreds of thousands at least. I can’t help but see it as a sad place where dreams come to die. A place full of emotionally frustrated people whose best chance to live a dream is to live a broken dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a park in the middle of the town, clearly meant for children to play but nobody’s there. It looks like nobody ever was there at all. The few people that do live there are probably too busy commuting to London and their important jobs. Why even bother putting a park in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m on my way to Manchester but thousands of people ride this train the opposite way to spend 8–10 hours in London and come home exhausted and emotionally spent. I know how it feels because I was there. I used to spend one hour commuting each way. And the trains are not what you imagine they are. They don’t even feel like a train, they feel like being stuck in a can of fish. They’re crowded to the point where you’re standing with your bag in your hand and can’t even move your arms because there’s literally no room. The bag that only weights a couple of kilos becoming heavier with each second that passes by, sweat pouring down your forehead, all the way to the eyes but you can’t swipe it. You can’t move, you’re stuck. And just when you thought it couldn’t get worse, the train stops at London Bridge — one of the busiest train stations in London. The train is completely full but there’s two times more people outside trying to board it. I get pushed further into the middle of the coach and I start fearing if I’ll be able to get off when the train reaches my station. Every breath gets heavier as the smell inside the train intensifies. I feel someone breathing down my neck, I hear another person’s music even though I’m listening to my own. I thought at first it couldn’t get worse but it did. But it will get even worse as the train keeps stopping and more people push their way onboard. Young mothers with baby strollers, commuters with bicycles… where are all these people coming from?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you lived here you’d be almost home? No thanks. I’m leaving London behind. It was a dream that turned out to be another broken dream. But broken dreams are there to teach us that what we want isn’t necessarily what we really need. And through that, we grow, we evolve and we mature. I’m thankful I tried living the London dream and I’m glad it turned out to be broken. Now I get to move to the next one. I refuse to live a life of frustrations, distractions and wasted time. A life of unexplored “what ifs”. A life that is outside of my control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2018/02/17/i-never-studied-design</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2018/02/17/i-never-studied-design/">&lt;p&gt;I come from a small, seaside town in Slovenia. By the time I finished high school I had already been designing and building websites for a couple of years. There was no digital design course in any of the faculties in Slovenia at the time so I decided to sign up for the Computer Science course in Ljubljana—Slovenia’s capital. I didn’t know what to expect but shortly after I started the course I realized that it wasn’t for me. Looking back now, I think I just wasn’t mature enough to see the potential in learning Java and stuff. So I dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropping out meant that I had to move back to my hometown and sign up for a course there. With a limited range of those available locally, I decided to study Management. Not because I had a dream of becoming a manager or an economist, it was simply the most generic option out there. And you know what they say—you need a degree to even stand a chance to get a job. All this time I was still designing and building stuff. Not just websites, but user interfaces and user experiences as well. I started out being completely clueless what UX design actually is. Whenever I didn’t know something, I improvised, made mistakes and learned from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there was no course guiding me towards “what I should be learning” I basically learned a bit of everything. I was frustrated by doing everything for my clients until I learned about the T-shaped skills at some point. I then decided to become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2017/08/06/specialised-generalist/&quot;&gt;specialised generalist&lt;/a&gt; and systematically develop my skills which included front-end development, writing, management, UX research so they would complement my UX/UI and visual design skills well. I was never happy doing just one step in the process and handing it over to the next person in line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a privilege of not being able to study design.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it now, I believe I had a privilege of not being able to study design. Privilege because I had to learn everything I know by myself. It’s a privilege also because I had the passion for doing design driving me onward. So I actually ended up doing what I really love, it was never just a fling. It was, and still is a journey driven by excitement of creating things and a hunger for learning. It started out as a dream, a hobby even. I never planned on becoming a designer but at some point it became a dream. A dream that was up to me to fulfil. And in the end, it was a privilege because I didn’t follow an established path towards becoming a designer. I learned what I had to, to get the job done, not something that a professor threw into a course’s curriculum. It was never something I could take for granted, it was something I had to fight for. If I wanted to be a designer, I simply had to do what designers do. That’s it, it’s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/12/22/my-favourite-books-of-2017</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/12/22/my-favourite-books-of-2017/">&lt;p&gt;Last year I challenged myself to read 40 books, this year, I skipped that challenge. Reading has become such an integral part of my life that I don’t need to trick myself into doing it anymore (challenging myself to read that many books was a way to build a strong routine). Before that, I had to force myself to start reading a new book. Now, I can’t wait to dig into the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s a list of books that I read this year and really liked. They’re not sorted in any particular order and none of them is directly design-related. I would categorise most of them as books about productivity, entrepreneurship, business and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-100-startup&quot;&gt;The $100 Startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388254436l/18883826.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;By Chris Guillebeau&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;By Chris Guillebeau &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first book that I read immediately after the new year. I received a Kindle Paperwhite as a Christmas gift and this was the first book that I bought with it. I loved the book so much, that I read it in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Guillebeau (the author) is a guy in his early thirties and never had a “real job”. He wrote the book as he travelled around the world on his quest to visit every country. I believe that by the time he wrote the book, he managed to visit 175 nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is an inspiration. He manages to live a lifestyle he wants and be completely free. He tells stories of other ordinary people that managed to break free. Free of “real jobs”, free of office desks an cubicles, free of all the bullshit. It was this book that inspired me to finally make one of my ideas happen—Better Web Type. You don’t need a lot of money to start your business. You just need to get shit done. And if what you’re selling is helpful to people, they will buy. And you can prove that what you’re saying is valuable by giving away stuff for free. We’ll get back to this concept later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway&quot;&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That idea that has been on your mind for the past few years? Go on and do it. “What if it fails?” is probably lurking somewhere in your mind. But what if it doesn’t? There’s nothing to lose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good is the enemy of great”—is the first sentence in this book. What a great start. I got this book for a couple of pounds on Amazon (used copy). It was a great investment in my understanding of business organisations and what makes the best ones stand out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-1&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Collins and his team of researchers spent 5 years researching American companies that stood out in their fields. After 6,000 articles and 2,000 pages of interviews transcript they came up with a list of a dozen of truly great companies. But the really important part was that they had a theory about what made these companies great and wrote down 7 key contributing factors and explored them. Definitely recommend this one but I have to warn you: reading it, you might realise that you work for a shit company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-1&quot;&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any company can become a great company but most don’t know how but even if they do, they’re afraid to face the inevitable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to read this one for a while but kinda dreaded it because it’s a huge, 600+ pages book. I worked for an early-stage startup at the time I added this book to my to-read list but I’m glad I kept putting it off. A few years later it helped me improve my process of validating what to do next with my personal projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-2&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book that needs to be on your desk if you work in product design &amp;amp; development. Especially if you’re in a small team or maybe even by yourself. It will help you find out if there’s a market for the thing that you’re building. The process is basically split into two steps: customer discovery and customer validation. What I really liked about the edition of the book that I read was that it had sections dedicated to building digital products. I walked away with a much better understanding of how to approach building a product (or even a company), and many ideas I could put to test straight away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-2&quot;&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find answers to pretty much anything by experimenting early and often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this book because I got it for £1 through a Kindle promotion and because I liked the cover (yes, I judge books by their covers). I wasn’t expecting much from it but was pleasantly surprised. I was afraid it would fall into the category of self-help books which I generally dislike. Instead, it was a story that I could closely relate to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-3&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. “Fuck positivity,” Mark Manson says. There’s a lot of shit in the world and the more fucks we give about everything, the more miserable we’ll be. Mark’s point is: there only so many things we can give a fuck about and we need to choose wisely what those things will be. Are your colleagues (schoolmates, whatever…) a bunch of morons who keep finding ways to pick on you? Fuck them. Are your parents selfish idiots to the point where they managed to ruin your childhood? Fuck them. Is the mainstream media trying to persuade you into believing that you’re in constant danger and the only thing that can help is buying (even) more stuff? Fuck them. Is your partner abusive, has a sense of entitlement of controlling your life and doesn’t let you live as you want? Fuck him too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark draws inspiration from minimalism, stoicism (which is something I’ve been reading about a lot lately) and his personal life stories. By the end, I really felt like I knew him personally. A very interesting, inspiring read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-3&quot;&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need to choose what’s important in your life and eliminate everything else. It’s hard to bring down a man who doesn’t give a flying fuck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally stumbled upon this book while browsing on my Kindle. Amazon suggested this book to me and their suggestion was spot on. Better Web Type had been released for a couple of months already when I read this book. Reading it, I realised that I built exactly what was described in it—unawarely of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-4&quot;&gt;What’s so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Lovell wrote this book based on his experience from building F2P (free-to-play) video games. But he manages to expand the book into other areas and does it well. His premises: build valuable things and give them away for free. Build a relationship with your customers based on trust and they’ll be ready to spend a lot of money on things that matter to them. The concept is simple: get in a lot of users by giving away stuff for free. Most of them will never buy from you, the majority of those that will buy, will spend an average amount on things you sell. But there will be a small amount of diehard fans that will be willing to spend lots of cash on things that really matter to them—that’s where the name—“The Curve”—comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaway-4&quot;&gt;Key takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build your customer relationship on trust and you’ll never have trouble selling your product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. These are my favourite 5 books of the 19 that I read this year. I hope that I gave you a few ideas on what to read next. What’s a cool book that you read this year?

        <summary type="html">Last year I challenged myself to read 40 books, this year, I skipped that challenge. Reading has become such an integral part of my life that I don’t need to trick myself into doing it anymore (challenging myself to read that many books was a way to build a strong routine). Before that, I had to force myself to start reading a new book. Now, I can’t wait to dig into the next one.</summary>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2017/12/02/6-things-i-hate-about-your-design-recruitment</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2017/12/02/6-things-i-hate-about-your-design-recruitment/">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.usejournal.com/6-things-i-hate-about-your-design-cv-349b52e6a5c6&quot;&gt;6 things I hate about your design CV&lt;/a&gt; article. I found myself on the hiring side numerous times already and although a bit disrespectful, the article genuinely offers good advice for designers that are just starting out. Finding and hiring good designers is hard and yes, companies get all sorts of applications. There’s simply a lot of it to get through—many people out there trying to start their design career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the mentioned article, I wanted to look at how companies get things wrong in the design hiring process because, well, there are a lot of them that do it poorly. It’s not as one-sided as it looks, or as some would want you to think.The things in my list are mostly based on my own experiences or inspired by stories other designers told me. 6 things that I hate about your design recruitment, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-a-generic-job-description&quot;&gt;1. A generic job description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you want to receive good-quality applications, write a decent job description. Don’t take one you find online, make a few changes and expect miracles. Describe what the role is, where it fits in and what is expected of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For remote positions: If your team is distributed but, for example, you’re US-based, write specifically if people applying should be US-based as well. Many companies don’t take the time to do this which results in a huge waste of time—on both sides. If you put out a shit job description, expect shit applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-lack-of-respect-towards-the-candidates&quot;&gt;2. Lack of respect towards the candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once applied to a Product Designer role in a well-known company (I won’t mention any names in this article). It wasn’t just a regular application, I had a connection inside the company and I was told by that person that he’ll make sure my application is taken seriously. It turned out I had to wait almost two months to get feedback, where they asked me for more work examples. After I prepared and sent that through, I received a short email from their recruiter. In it, she said that they wanted to invite me to a full-day interview at their headquarters and included a schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I haven’t spoken to anyone from the company. That email was literally all I heard from them. So I asked: “can you tell me at what stage of the recruitment process am I and would there be another stage after the full-day interview?” After that I finally had a proper chat with the recruiter. In the end, based on the information she gave me, I decided not to proceed with my application for personal reasons. I sent an email to the recruiter explaining that and received no reply ever since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a typical “company with an attitude” as I started calling them. Dealing with them, I felt like they were doing me a favour for even considering me as a candidate for the job, instead of making me feel welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-treating-candidates-likenumbers&quot;&gt;3. Treating candidates like numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another “well-known” company. Probably the biggest in the world when it comes to how many designers they have. It all started quite well, the recruiter genuinely seemed to be interested in me as a person. All seemed well-structured, too. Interview with the recruiter first, two one-hour interviews second and another final interview after that. They booked my two interviews for the second stage—each with a different product designer. They let me know the schedule and who I’d be interviewing with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I researched the two designers I was supposed to interview with but didn’t help at all. Why? Well, because I was told on the day of the interview that the two designers were unavailable and that I’d have the interview with two other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ok, I was taken to this small, windowless room. Only a small desk and two chairs were inside. It was so small that nothing else would fit anyway. So small in fact that it made me feel uncomfortable. I had a brief chat with the recruiter who gave me some quick advice and then left as the person for the first interview arrived. I had 45 minutes to present two of my projects and a couple of minutes for a few questions. Immediately after that, the second person entered the room and the first one rushed off. One hour later, the second person rushed off as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of them showed zero interest in me as a candidate, none of them even bothered to get a printed copy of my CV. From the questions they asked me, it was also clear that they didn’t take a look at it at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t make it to the final round but the way they made me feel caused me to doubt my wish to join the company. The only thing that really attracted me was their big name and the possibility to do product design well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-looking-to-get-free-work-through-designtasks&quot;&gt;4. Looking to get free work through “design tasks”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A designer told me a story about how he recently applied for a job at a cool investment startup but was asked to do not one, but two design tasks. He completed both of them but was turned down. He was told that they wanted the problems solved in a way that would be unusual to them—whatever that means. I wouldn’t be surprised if that startup ended up using some of the work he did for them for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still asking the designers to do test design tasks to evaluate their capabilities you need to stop. With the little information that you’ll give them, they won’t be able to come up with a viable solution and you’re wasting their time. Plenty has been written about this but here’s a quick recap: the best way to evaluate designers is through an on-site whiteboard challenge where they can interact with other people from the company so they can get the required information to do the job. Acquiring information is a fundamental part of design and by sending a task over email and letting them come up with a solution in isolation is a recipe for disaster. Good design doesn’t happen in isolation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-not-involving-other-people-from-thecompany&quot;&gt;5. Not involving other people from the company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world (for designers), everyone is a designer. Everyone knows the basic principles of design and possesses the design common sense (capability of design thinking). But we don’t live in a perfect world. Designers, once in the intended position, won’t be talking to other designers alone. They’ll need to communicate with other people like product managers, engineers, marketing etc. So why are you only involving designers in the recruitment/interviewing process? Why aren’t you including other people that the hired person will have to work with? See if they get along? Give them a task and see if they can collaborate well together? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers usually get along. It’s easy to talk about pretty colours and icons or admire well-designed animations and spend a couple of hours doing just that. It’s easy for us to get along, but for the newly-hired designers to do well, they’ll need to get along with other people too. People that don’t speak the design language. Involve those people in the recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-lure-designers-in-based-on-falsepromises&quot;&gt;6. Lure designers in based on false promises&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies do this. It’s easy to lure designers in promising all sorts of cool stuff—good salary, ways of working, design-centred culture, whatever makes designers happy. Yes, you’ll get to hire cool designers that know their shit. But after the honeymoon period is over, they’ll want to leave. Those promises you gave at the beginning? Nowhere to be seen. They realised you conned them and they’ll be gone as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t promise a range of salary of $60,000 to $100,000 if you’re only willing to give $60,000 to pretty much anyone (regardless of their experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t promise them a design-centred culture in the company if you know that there’s no such thing. Let them know what to expect, the good stuff and the challenges.
I once joined a company that was promising a good range of salary and a great way of working. By the end of the hiring process, I was offered the minimum of the salary range but I still took the job because I was expecting a cool design-centred culture established in the company along with a great way of doing stuff. Do I need to tell you that none of that turned out to be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-little-thingsmatter&quot;&gt;The little things matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as little things matter in design CVs, they matter even more in the recruitment processes. Basic things like: replying to emails, not taking ages to give any sort of feedback and show some respect. Lots of “big name” companies look for humility in designers but don’t show any of it on their side. If you’re looking for humble and honest people, act humble and be honest. There’s no room for bullshit in the design recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on the design recruitment process? Do you have stories to share? Let me know in the comments bellow :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/11/25/what-its-all-about/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What it’s all about" />
      <published>2017-11-25T20:56:54+01:00</published>
      <updated>2017-11-25T20:56:54+01:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/11/25/what-its-all-about</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/11/25/what-its-all-about/">&lt;p&gt;I created the course because I felt there was no concise way to learn the skills required to make typography an integral part of a web design process. The gap between designers and developers is still there and I haven’t seen many projects that are trying to address that. Better Web Type at its core is exactly that—it starts off explaining typography, how it works, why web developers need to learn about it and then shows them how. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because I never expected it to grow as much as it did, I also didn’t expect there would eventually be costs to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really expected to make money from the project and I also never expected that it would grow as it did. So far, it has helped more than 15,000 designers and developers understand web typography and—what’s more important—enabled them to work together better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, one of the biggest fans and supporters of my work—Harry—sent me an email after he purchased my book for the second time, this time in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-book&quot;&gt;newly released paperback format&lt;/a&gt; (Harry if you’re reading, cheers!). He told me how much my work has helped him improve his and sent me a design he was working on. He got everything right: the contrast, the whitespace, the typefaces, the scale, the horizontal rhythm, the vertical rhythm, the punctuation… everything! It was a textbook execution of all the stuff I wrote about in the Better Web Type book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two magic moments that happen in the process of starting your own business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you sell your product for the first time and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you realise how helpful it is to the people who buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example I described above was clearly the second of the two. But unlike the first one, the second one can be a repeating event. I keep getting positive emails from people I helped so far. Sometimes people even send me physical mail like postcards, which I find pretty cool. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s my secret:&lt;/em&gt; yes, it’s really cool when someone buys the book and I earn a couple of dollars because of that. It helps me cover the costs of running this project plus a little something extra on top—something I can put in my savings. I still get excited every time someone buys the book, just like the first time it happened. But I get even more excited when I receive an email like the one mentioned above. It makes me happy to a point where it brings a tear to my eye. And with every such email I receive, with contrast to the book sale moment, this feeling gets amplified. I feel better about my work when I see how helpful it is to other people. And this is what it’s all about. It’s not the what or how, it’s the why. And my why is simple—help designers and developers understand typography and help them work together better. That’s it. It really is as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t seen it yet, make sure you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA&amp;amp;t=6s&quot;&gt;Start With Why&lt;/a&gt; by Simon Sinek.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  “Data-driven” is all the rage at the moment, everyone wants a slice of the “big data” cake. Data scientists are the new rock stars, replacing the JavaScript and Front-end gurus and ninjas from a few years back. My problem with trends like these is that they cause the so called “tunnel-vision”. Thing x is a trend right now and we should do that too because,… you know… everyone’s doing it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like at the moment, companies take pride in how “data-driven” they are. It must be a good thing, because big, fancy companies claim to be so. All these companies risk ending up in a tunnel where quantitative tests claim to provide the answers to all questions. But there’s a reason why there’s a qualitative way of acquiring feedback. The quantitative tests are good in providing information about the ‘what’, but they usually can’t give us an answer to the ‘why’. This is exactly where the qualitative side comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/08/25/the-day-i-proved-myself-wrong/">&lt;p&gt;Designers don’t know why a small change to an interface results in a massive drop in a core business metric, product managers don’t know what should go into the backlog and what not, developers don’t know how to estimate the delivery time of the fancy new feature. The whole team behind the product is so clueless that they don’t even know if the new feature brings any value to the users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come up with our pity assumptions and hypothesis and we try to validate them. We try to show that we’re right, that’s what we’re being paid for right? Being smart and all… We’re certain we’re right… until we’re proven wrong. Time and time again. But even then, we doubt the validity of the test and we doubt the meaning of a metric if we need to. So we run another A/B test or more user testing sessions. We spend days or even weeks to get a similar result. Another result that we don’t really know how to interpret. The process feels like making tiny steps in the dark—expecting meaningful results by doing the same thing over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Certainty is the enemy of growth. Nothing is for certain until it has already happened—and even then, it’s debatable. That’s why accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place. Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt… Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are. Being wrong opens up to the possibility of change.&lt;br /&gt;
—Mark Manson&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our industry is plagued with certainty. Smartass people with thick heads who are certain in their own work because they have been doing it for 10+ years or whatever. I came across many people like that but in a way, we’re all the same. It’s our process of creating something and then proving that it’s correct that is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-real-life-example&quot;&gt;A real-life example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, we had a discussion at work. If you go to a typical car ad on Auto Trader today, you’ll see that it’s being sold by a “Trade Seller”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain group of people inside the company believe that it should be replaced with the actual name of the company selling the car because it would be clearer to the user. I am one of those people. We even had discussions of including that seller information (including their rating) in the search results. So I decided to prove that the “Trade Seller” bit is confusing the users. I was certain that they don’t understand what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I devised two tests with Usability Hub in a way that the results could be easily quantified. I mocked up search results with seller rating in two versions: one with “Trade Seller + rating” and another one with “Actual seller name + rating”. I was looking to answer two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do users understand what the “Trade seller / actual seller name mean”?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And  do they understand what is the rating next to it referring to? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, I was certain to prove:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that people don’t understand what “Trade seller” means and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that they won’t understand that the rating is of the seller when placed next to the “Trade seller” text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising and humbling. I did find answers to both questions but they were the complete opposite of what I wanted to prove. The results showed that people do understand what “Trade seller” means. Actually, in the test most of them knew exactly what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets crazy. Not only did the participants understand what “Trade seller” means. They understood what the rating is of better when it was next to “Trade seller” instead of the actual name of the seller. In the v1 of the test (“Trade seller”), 86% of participants knew what it meant and 93% of them said that the rating is of the seller. In the v2, 100% of participants claimed that the names were the car dealerships that were selling the listed cars but only 46% of them said that the rating is of the seller. The rest assumed it was a rating of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I proved myself wrong on both accounts. People know what “Trade seller” means and they understand that the rating next to it is of the seller and not of the car (I ran the test two times with a total of 40 participants for each version, just to be sure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The A/B test was already planned and ready to go. I had to stop it, so we could first see if users understand the information correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we only found out about that because of the way the test was devised—qualitative feedback that can be quantified. The initial plan was to simply run a quantitative A/B test and see if it has an effect on our core business metrics. That would never teach us what we learned through this simple test. We couldn’t interpret the result correctly because we wouldn’t know if the users even understand the information presented. But the worst part is: we wouldn’t even know that. We would end up with an uneducated guess and we wouldn’t even realise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always leave room for uncertainty. Not to the point where we’re paralysed by it and scared to make a choice. Decide based on the information you have at the moment but question your solution. Assume it’s wrong and try to prove it’s wrong. Failing is a better way to learn than running A/B tests to (sometimes falsely) confirm the validity of your solution. Forget your ego and forget your entitlement to be correct. Even if you have been doing this for years. Or maybe especially because of that. Things change, we need to remain humble and admit that we don’t understand everything and that we make mistakes. But if we admit it, we can learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2017-08-06T21:56:54+02:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/08/06/specialised-generalist</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/08/06/specialised-generalist/">&lt;p&gt;Compared to them, I felt mediocre and I was frustrated because of it. You see, I never specialised in anything. Since I was a child, I had a habit of putting things together and create something out of that. I saw things differently from others. Where everyone else saw a cardboard box, I saw a cool military jeep that I could create out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was different. Or at least, at that point I thought it was. I was studying management and economics at a local university when I turned my hobby into a small business that was enough to get by. I was doing proper UX/UI design work for clients worldwide. Looking back, I now realise I was doing well. But that didn’t mean much to me. People wouldn’t hire me to draw pretty illustrations and they wouldn’t hire me to do front-end development stuff. They hired me to bring their brands to life (yes back then I did that sort of work too) and design their websites. They hired me to design user experiences and do pretty much everything design-related for them—including building and deploying the websites I designed for their projects.  Believe it or not, that only fueled my frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/skills-before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These would be the skills that I had then. Enough of each to get by, but not really specialised in anything. At least that’s how I felt at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;t-shaped-skills&quot;&gt;T-shaped skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, I stumbled upon the “T-shaped skills” concept. I had never heard of anything similar before. Let’s take a look at what exactly it means: &lt;em&gt;Having skills and knowledge that are both deep and broad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I decided to dig deeper and I learned that generalists (people with such skills) are in high demand at some of the best companies. Companies that solve tough problems using the so-called design thinking. That was the first time that I saw my lack of specialism as something that could potentially be good. Looking back now, it seems that at that moment, I made a subconscious decision to become a generalist. A while later it became clear to me that being a generalist is an amazing thing (and that I was a generalist already anyway) so I made a conscious decision to specialise in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/t-shaped-skills.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, generalists don’t necessarily have average skills all around. The name “generalist” tends to imply that but it’s not true. Once I decided to become a proper generalist I decided that UX/UI would be my main skill so I would put most effort into improving that. But being a generalist means that I put a lot of effort into picking up other, complementing skills. Web design, native apps design, visual design, front-end development, design-thinking, prototyping etc. They would all get an equally important part in acquiring and developing skills. And it’s not just acquiring skills for the sake of it. It’s acquiring skills with an intent to use them or in most cases even acquiring skills by using them before acquiring them (learning by doing)—which often requires improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/skills-now.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal changed from naively striving to be the best at everything (and wasting energy and time to get there) to making small and systematic steps towards becoming the &lt;em&gt;most complete designer I can be&lt;/em&gt;. Since I consciously started working on specialising as a generalist, my skills set is more complete. I know that my illustration and animation skills are still quite basic, but so far, they were always good enough. That’s what being a generalist means to me: knowing how to apply the skills you already have and pick up new ones when needed and apply them immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-being-a-generalist-a-goodthing&quot;&gt;Why is being a generalist a good thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People possessing these [broad] skills are able to shape their knowledge to fit the problem at hand rather than insist that their problems appear in a particular, recognizable form. Given their wide experience in applying functional knowledge, they are capable of convergent, synergistic thinking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about a real-life scenario. We have two teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team A:&lt;/em&gt; Sam is a UX/UI designer with an interest in front-end development and product design/management. Other members of the team are John, a full-stack web developer and Scarlet, a product manager. John has a particular interest in UX and design in general. Scarlet, the product manager, has some UX background and loves doing UX research and customer development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team B:&lt;/em&gt; Allison is a UI designer. She likes to create pretty things and hates when other people make her push pixels around. Emma is a UX designer, she loves creating wireframes and prototypes. She’s comfortable with letting Allison take over from there. Peter is a product manager, he loves coming up with ideas for products and thinks that’s his responsibility. Eric is a full-stack developer as he does both: back- and front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for T-shaped skills surfaces anywhere problem solving is required across different deep functional knowledge bases or at the juncture of such deep knowledge with an application area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Leonard-Barton&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research suggests, that people who have broad skills communicate and work with others better. It makes sense: because Sam from team A knows a bit about front-end development, it’s much easier to talk to web developers and explain what needs to be done. The same goes the other way, John—team A’s full-stack developer knows a bit about design so he can suggest improvements the designer might have missed. Team A is a small squad that has the skills and the mentality required to find out what needs to be built and then go on and build it. Put a good product development process on top of that and the chances of success rise dramatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team B on the other hand, is much more likely to have communication issues. Designers that aren’t comfortable getting feedback early and often can’t function in teams that need to move fast. Product managers that think that coming up with product ideas is solely their responsibility are hard to work with because they hate it when people question their ideas. Allison, the UX designer likes the wireframing and prototyping part but doesn’t have a habit of seeing products through to the end. Eric, the team B’s full-stack developer is the person that comes closest to being a generalist. But it’s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that everyone should aim to become a generalist. There’s room for specialists in product development teams too. But there needs to be the right balance of the two. What I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; saying though is that being a generalist is fun. Having a holistic overview of the product development process and see things through to the end. Making sure that things get built as they were intended and learn how to improve with the next iteration at the same time. I don’t really think it’s just about acquiring and using different skills—It’s a mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched an email course called Better Web Type on 14 February this year. It introduces the topic of typography to people who actually design and build websites—web designers and web developers. Split into 10 daily lessons, it covers topics like rhythm in web typography, how to use modular scales, how to combine typefaces and similar. It was featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/&quot;&gt;CSS-tricks&lt;/a&gt;, as a cover feature in the Net magazine, in the Web Designer magazine, as well as sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-295/&quot;&gt;Codrops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/web-development-reading-list-186/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The course is highly-rated with an average of 4.7 out of 5 after more than 700 reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students that went through the course loved it so much that they started asking for a book. Writing a book on the same topic was always on my roadmap but the high demand turned it into my top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was released as an eBook on July 31 and is available to &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-book&quot;&gt;order on the Better Web Type website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;second edition&lt;/em&gt; of the book was released in February 2019. Digital extras like Sketch files, cheat sheets and similar were added to the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2017/06/09/equilateral-triangle-of-a-perfect-paragraph</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2017/06/09/equilateral-triangle-of-a-perfect-paragraph/">&lt;p&gt;And the lack of knowledge about typography doesn’t come from ignorance. I learned that web designers are commonly either self-taught and haven’t grasped the importance of typography yet, or they actually studied design but typography was just one of the classes they had to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com&quot;&gt;Better Web Type&lt;/a&gt; course to help raise awareness of the important role typography plays on the web. In my opinion, both web designers and web developers should learn the basics—if a designer uses ligatures in her designs but the developer doesn’t even know what ligatures are, how can we expect him to correctly transform the most beautifully designed typography into code? With both roles knowing the basics, we’ll be able to start contributing to a better web by producing better web typography. Together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things in typography is to shape a seamless reading experience that invites the reader and presents the content in an objective way. To do that, we need to be able to shape perfect paragraphs. There are three keys to doing that, as Josef Mueller-Brockmann—a renowned 20th-century typographer and visual communicator, put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The reader should be able to read the message of a text easily and comfortably. This depends to a not inconsiderable extent on the size of the type, the length of the lines and the leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Equilateral triangle of a perfect paragraph article was originally published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/&quot;&gt;CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt; where you can read the rest. I launched a learning game based on this theory at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/triangle-game.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that as many people as possible come across this game and learn that line-height, font-size, and length of lines always need to be considered together. Try to get the best result and challenge your friends. The more people know about this, the better the web typography will get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2017/04/30/getting-things-done-with-trello</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2017/04/30/getting-things-done-with-trello/">&lt;p&gt;Most people will enjoy the nice weather or take a trip. I use this precious time to do some work on my projects. Sounds dull, but deep down it makes me happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Better Web Type has been on my to-do list for almost two years. Mostly because I didn’t know what to do and where to&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched a project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com&quot;&gt;Better Web Type&lt;/a&gt; in February and my new website shortly after that. Better Web Type is an email course I wanted to do for a while but never really took the time. It required a lot of work and that was one of the reasons why I kept postponing it. Then I learned what are the best ways to move projects forward. It boils down to three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break big problems down into small chunks that are easier to solve,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put a deadline to all these small steps,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have an overview of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello, for me, plays an essential role in this process. I use it for both, my personal projects and my personal/professional development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-trello-for-personalprojects&quot;&gt;Using Trello for personal projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each project gets its own board in Trello. Each board has four columns: Ideas, To Do, Doing, Done. The ‘Ideas’ column helps me a lot when it comes to quickly putting down, well, ideas. I have the Trello app on my iPhone so I can put something there anytime. Most of my ideas come out of the blue so that’s the best way for me to capture them. If I decide at some point that an idea won’t make it, I simply archive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-01-board.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cards should form a shape of a “bridge”. I always try to keep only one card in To Do and Doing columns.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The cards should form a shape of a “bridge”. I always try to keep only one card in To Do and Doing columns. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to making a Kan Ban system (which Trello in its essence is) work, is to keep things moving and staying lean. Don’t have too many things in the ‘To Do’ and ‘Doing’ columns. If something gets stuck in there it needs to get unstuck and moved forwards (or in some cases even backwards). I always try to have only one item in each of those columns. This way I can see what I’m working on at the moment and what’s the thing that comes next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro tip: if an item is stuck in one of these two columns for too long but you’re not sure why, try to break it down into smaller tasks. Move some of them backwards if necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last is the ‘Done’ column. It seems completely unnecessary to have that column there at first. But what I found out is that it helps with motivation. When there’s hard things that need to be done and you’re starting to despair, a list, full of tasks that were already completed show that you really can do anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-trello-for-personalprofessional-development&quot;&gt;Using Trello for personal/professional development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how an where to draw the line between the personal and professional development. Almost everything I do in free time helps with my professional development and I enjoy doing what I do anyway. I guess it’s the same question as when it comes to work/life balance. It’s not even a question when work is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-02-planning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My ‘Planning’ board is made of short term (ST) and long term (LT) plans cards.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My ‘Planning’ board is made of short term (ST) and long term (LT) plans cards. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the basic—To Do, Doing and Done columns for this. The trick here is that I have two types of cards. One for long term and one for short, long term for a year and short for the current quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term card gets a name like ‘LT—2017’ and it’s there that I write down the things that I want to do in the current year, broken down into quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-03-card.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My LT plan card consists of a broad plan for the current year, split into quarters.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My LT plan card consists of a broad plan for the current year, split into quarters. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description is then followed by a number of checklists. Ticking things in these lists helps me with motivation again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short term card is more detailed. It has checklists for things I want to read, projects I want to do, articles and newsletters I want to write and skills I want to work on in the current quarter. For example, in this quarter (April–June), I want to read five books, work on various Better Web Type projects and write a couple of articles. This newsletter is also in the list of things I planned for this quarter. As you see in the screenshot, there’s no skills that I plan working on in this quarter. In the past I had things like completing the React.js and Python courses there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-04-card-details.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The short term card is mostly made of checklists of things I want to do in the upcoming 3 months.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The short term card is mostly made of checklists of things I want to do in the upcoming 3 months. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-thingsforward&quot;&gt;Moving things forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing in completing projects is moving things forward. As I said, Trello plays a key role in that for me but Trello alone isn’t enough. I figured that out a while ago. I had things broken down into small steps and planned but kept failing at actually completing them. Then I found out how important it is to 1. have a deadline for every small thing in the ‘To Do’ list and 2. have a constant overview over the progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things help me with this. At work, I have a small notebook where I write down the todos for each week. Every morning when I come in I check that list and decide what I’ll work on that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-05-notebook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My to dos for the week 13.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My to dos for the week 13. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I have a whiteboard where I do a similar thing. I have a weekly to do list but I also write down all the small steps that need to be done for a project and put a date next to them. It’s not so much about meeting the deadline. It’s more about putting a sense of urgency to the tasks. Urgency that is commonly not there when we work on personal projects. A deadline will push you to do things, even if you have to move it for a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-06-whiteboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The whiteboard wall at home keeps reminding me of things that need to be done, by when and motivates me at the same time.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The whiteboard wall at home keeps reminding me of things that need to be done, by when and motivates me at the same time. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you noticed it but I don’t have deadlines next to my tasks in the notebook at work. That’s exactly because of that sense of urgency. There’s no lack of that at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overview of the progress is essential. Before, I had these tasks written down in Trello but it was so easy to forget about them. Now I have them where I can’t miss them. I check the notepad at work every day and I can’t not see the big whiteboard I have at home. These help me remind of things that need to be done everyday and motivates me when I see things that have already been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it work with Trello? I usually have the top-level description of the task in Trello and the small steps required to complete it on my whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-thingsdone&quot;&gt;Getting things done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really happy that I managed to perfect my working process like that. It took me a while to figure it out but now I’m finally in a place where I manage to get my personal projects through the door. They’re not just an idea I want to work on at some time. They’re turned into a series of small steps that don’t seem scary and get done by a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2017/01/13/putting-up-a-wall/">&lt;p&gt;And that’s alright because that was a huge part of their empire. They swore to themselves never to let their guard down after Rome was sacked by the Gauls in its early history. Because of that, they developed a highly organised, professional war machine. They conquered whatever they set their sights on. And they remained hungry — after each conquest they already had plans for the next one. At their peak, the Romans controlled the region between the frozen Scottish highlands in the north and the sandy deserts of north Africa in the south. But then — they stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emperor Hadrian decided to put up walls to “protect the empire”. His decision meant that he was happy with what he had. Protecting his lands became more important than conquering new ones. It was a drastic shift in mentality. A mentality that Romans never adopted before. Until then, they were always on the offensive, expanding further into unknown. The more they conquered, the more resources they had to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, all of a sudden, they decided to put this war machine on hold. They put their legions on the walls where, for most of the time, they waited. The most effective army in the world was put on a defensive. They couldn’t use their skills so often anymore and they didn’t have to learn new ones to overcome new obstacles. The decline of the army started. The sharp swords got dull. The tactics were forgotten. A few generations later, it was nowhere near the might of the early empire. The downfall had started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-put-up-a-wall-draw-aline&quot;&gt;Don’t put up a wall, draw a line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can learn from this story is that we should never put up our walls. We should never draw the line and be happy with what we have. I don’t mean that in a materialistic way. Money and materialism are the worst things to drive someone forward. Look beyond that and see what you want to achieve. Are you looking for knowledge to satisfy your hunger of curiosity? Are you looking to pick up skills that will always keep you sharp — in step with time? The moment you put up that wall will be the moment of the start of your decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put up a wall once. I was in the middle of transitioning from web design to UI &amp;amp; visual design and I thought to myself: it’s my job to make this look nice, I don’t want to worry about coding it. That’s developer’s job. I was happy with my UI &amp;amp; visual design skills so I put up a wall around them. My ignorance turned into fear. Fear of code and anything about it. I had basic web design skills from before but started neglecting them. JavaScript was what I dreaded the most. I had always relied on my brother, who’s a full stack developer, whenever I needed anything done in Javascript or jQuery. Even if it was a simple animated scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then one day, out of the blue, I decided it was time to change. I tore that wall down. It happened in an instant. I decided that my skills weren’t good enough as they were. I finally decided to face my fear. I started learning JavaScript. I completed the course on Codecademy. I read a book. I started coding and exploring what I can do with my newly acquired skill. I conquered my fear. I broke trough the wall and the only thing that I had on my mind was: “okay, what’s next?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through conquering that fear, I rediscovered my hunger. My curiosity. My mind shifted. Now I feel like there’s nothing that I can’t do. The opposite. I can do anything I put my mind to. It may need more time at first but I will do it. Now I don’t put up walls anymore. I draw lines. These lines don’t represent the current state. They don’t represent something that I’m happy with. They represent a point in the future. They represents skills I want to acquire, products I want to build and the person I want to be. Lines can be moved. Walls can’t.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/12/08/a-two-step-no-bullshit-guide-to-sketching</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/12/08/a-two-step-no-bullshit-guide-to-sketching/">&lt;p&gt;In the last dispatch I wrote about my story of how I learned that &lt;a href=&quot;/personal-notes/2016/11/03/my-sketches-arent-perfect/&quot;&gt;sketches aren’t meant to be perfect&lt;/a&gt;. How they aren’t meant to give final answers. They’re meant to ask further questions. To doubt your own solutions. And with that comes a lot more sketching. Sketching is not something you do at the start of the process, produce a wonderful looking sketch and move on. Sketching needs to be done throughout the design process. And in order to produce more sketches quicker, the quality of sketching needs to move aside. Here’s quick overview of my sketching kit followed by a few tips to make sketching serve its true meaning in your design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sketching-kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My sketch kit: A Schneider Topliner 967, a Sharpie and a shader.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My sketch kit: A Schneider Topliner 967, a Sharpie and a shader. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-a-sharpie&quot;&gt;Start with a sharpie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some designers will use a pencil to start drawing their early sketches. They do so because their ideas aren’t clear yet. So they draw an interface, see it’s not right, erase parts of it and draw them again. This is a great way to start spending too much time on one sketch only and start thinking about details way too early. My recommendation is don’t use a pencil and an eraser. Use a sharpie instead. Or something similar, as long as the tip of the pen is thick and will produce thick lines. This will force you to not focus on details and to make mistakes. Mistakes that you can’t erase. So to fix a mistake you have to draw a new version of the sketch. I know, you’re probably thinking: “but that’s a waste of time!” Here’s the tricky part. These early sketches should be so simple that it takes you very little time to produce. By little time I mean less than a minute. If it’s not the right solution you just discard it without feeling sorry for wasting effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, it’s important that you try to explore different ideas, solutions, combinations of different UI elements and interactions. Once you have that in front of you, you’ll start seeing patterns and connections that you couldn’t see before. You might want to try and combine a few sketches into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro tip: try to sketch on a large canvas like a big paper, a whiteboard or a even a wall. Don’t use a small notepad. This will make you even faster and you’ll have a nice overview of your progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/early-sketches.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A total of 6 different sketches were explored in this particular process (as seen here with my notes on stickies).&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A total of 6 different sketches were explored in this particular process (as seen here with my notes on stickies). &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;converge-and-add-some-details&quot;&gt;Converge and add (some) details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be more comfortable with what you produced through sketching at this point. You’ve explored different ideas, layouts, UI elements… You might have combined some of them already and there’s probably a version of the sketch or two that you think might be the right ones. But there’s still lots of questions. It’s time to draw a bit more detailed sketches. Here’s where my Schindler and shader pens come in. The title that was just a wavy line before now becomes actual text. The paragraphs are still wavy lines. The UI elements become more detailed as well. The button is not just a dark box, it’s a box with text and some shading. You might even add some (basic) representations of icons at this point. It’s ok to spend more time on these sketches. It’s ok because you’ve already answered a lot of questions. At this point, the only way to start answering more questions is to add details. And it’s ok to do so because you narrowed down your solution to one or two sketches earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">In the last dispatch I wrote about my story of how I learned that sketches aren’t meant to be perfect. How they aren’t meant to give final answers. They’re meant to ask further questions. To doubt your own solutions. And with that comes a lot more sketching. Sketching is not something you do at the start of the process, produce a wonderful looking sketch and move on. Sketching needs to be done throughout the design process. And in order to produce more sketches quicker, the quality of sketching needs to move aside. Here’s quick overview of my sketching kit followed by a few tips to make sketching serve its true meaning in your design process.</summary>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/11/03/my-sketches-arent-perfect/">&lt;p&gt;This means that I started to sketch a lot more. I always loved to sketch, scribble and draw. I always felt this need to put something on the paper. Something visual I can refer to later on. Something I put out of my head—an idea that gets transformed into something physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a particular time when I was looking for some inspiration and stumbled upon this sketch. The effect it had on me was the opposite of what I was looking for. It didn’t inspire me. It demotivated me. My sketches were never made of straight lines, shading and nice depictions of people, maps and UI elements. My sketches were ugly, with lots of corrections, lines that were too long, boxes that were too small. If someone took a look at them they wouldn’t be able to understand a thing without my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketches-arent-supposed-to-be-perfect&quot;&gt;Sketches aren’t supposed to be perfect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s the thing about sketches. There’s a secret that not a lot of designers know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental thing about sketching is that it is about asking not telling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Bill Buxton&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your sketches don’t have to tell anything to anyone else but yourself. Even then, they’re merely a tool to ask further questions. By asking further questions we get to asking the right questions. Eventually. And only if you ask yourself enough questions. This means, a lot of sketching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of sketching is not to do a perfect sketch that looks awesome. It’s not for sharing information with others. It’s for putting an idea to the paper. For me personally, it’s one of the three magic moments in the design process. By drawing one sketch that looks more like a drawing, designers miss the main purpose of sketching. To depict an idea as it is currently in your head—with all the holes that represent the missing information. By drawing as many sketches as possible and putting as many ideas from your head to paper we get in the right mindset and start to discover the missing parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you want to sketch something, don’t pay any attention to what your sketch looks like. Instead, try to produce as many as possible—different ideas, multiple possible solutions our different combinations of UI elements. Your job shouldn’t be assessed based on your sketches. It’s the final product that we need to focus on. You sketches need to be something that you can throw away if it’s not what you need. It’s something that you spend minutes drawing instead of hours. It’s something that will take you from a cloud of ideas to a functioning product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might even argue that sketching is a complete waste of time and should be skipped altogether. It either takes too long or it’s done very quickly. Both arguments serve as a good excuse to do so. I mentioned earlier that I think sketching is one of the three magic moments in the design process (I’ll write about these at some time). Sketching is the most important one. Your idea takes form for the first time and makes everything clearer. It’s not a perfect representation of what you want to do but this is where the magic of sketching lies. They can, should and will change through time. The quicker they change, the better.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/10/13/you-are-not-who-you-think-you-are/">&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “Sign here and you’ll resign from the technical high school”, said the headmaster as he gave me a disappointed look. It was the resignation letter. I had no choice but sign it. I had skipped way too many classes. I went over the limit and this was the next step in the process. But it wasn’t just about skipping classes. I wasn’t doing well at school at all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was surprised by how my first years of high school went. Until then I never had problems in school. In fact, school never really posed a challenge to me. All I needed to do to get trough the year was a minimal effort. The first year of high school followed a similar fashion. No major problems, completed with minimal effort. Some trouble would arise occasionally but nothing too serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class teacher figured me out though. She noticed that I’m not investing enough time in school matters and that I could be doing a lot better if I did. Soon she would start to label me as lazy. She literally called me “lazy boy” (she taught English). She did that publicly. Maybe it was her way of trying to wake me up and motivate me. Well, it didn’t work. Quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matej-is-clever-butlazy&quot;&gt;Matej is clever, but lazy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being publicly labeled as lazy made things worse. My schoolmates treated me as such and other teachers as well. “Matej is clever but he’s lazy” is what they would say about me. And that triggered the opposite effect of what they wanted to achieve. It made me care about school even less. I had less problems with skipping classes. I eventually failed a year and dropped out soon after that. I was already perceived as a failure so why not act as one as well? It may sound stupid but that’s how people work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an experiment conducted in India. The students from different castes had to take a test. They were split into two groups—one that had to publicly tell what caste they’re from and another where the students didn’t have to do that. The students from the lower castes in the first group performed worse than the students from the higher caste but their lower caste colleagues performed the same as the ones from the higher caste in the other group. This means that the lower caste students that had to publicly disclose their caste subconsciously felt that they had to perform worse than the ones from the higher caste so they did. We are not who we think we are. We are what the environment and the society we live in dictate us to be. You can read more about the experiment here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing with me was… I wasn’t lazy at all. I just didn’t care enough. I preferred playing video games day in day out. Red Alert 2, Half-Life, Quake 3 Arena… you name it, I played it. The time I skipped an annoying class to go home early with a bag of candy and play video games was the time of my life. Besides, when I wasn’t playing video games I was coding and designing websites. More for fun than anything else but as it turned out, it was these skills that took me places, not the ones I learned in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not who you think you are. I am not who I think I am. We are defined by so many factors and the society is a large part of it. But if we acknowledge that, we might be able to regain our identities. Maybe just a small part. So… who are you?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2016-10-04T21:56:54+02:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/10/04/faster-horses</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/10/04/faster-horses/">&lt;div class=&quot;conversation&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses” is a quote attributed to Henry Ford. It’s a quote that many people use as an excuse not to do user testing. Because designers and product managers are supposed to be these geniuses that pull ideas out of thin air. Steve Jobs was one of those design/product gurus. All the designer and product manager wannabes have a quote or two from Steve that they hold close to their heart so they feel more secure about themselves. But neither Steve or Henry became famous for their ideas because they would be original. They weren’t. Steve didn’t make the first computer and Henry didn’t make the first car (he made the first car assembly line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone quotes one of these guys, they try to convince other people in the room that it’s a designer’s job to know what the users want and need. But if there’s no research and no interaction with (potential) customers, how is a designer supposed to know that? It’s not that designers design products for themselves. And if they do, they’re probably not that good at designing anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very recent case where we were working on redesigning a product at Auto Trader we conducted some quick user testing with the people from our company. Some people suggested not to do that because the quality of the feedback will be low. They’re too invested in the product and know too much about it. Supposedly. We went on and did some testing anyway. We told them what the scenario was and what we want them to do. We were testing the UX of the new product and the UIs of some of the screens that were redesigned. A basic clickable wireframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of research done before we started working on redesigning the product and we didn’t expect to learn much. We were looking for a validation of what we had. But the people that we tested with started coming up with questions. “How do I buy a new car from this page?”, “Where can I see how long the car dealer has been in business?” etc. This were the questions that people haven’t asked until that point. We then explored why they were asking these questions and quickly went back to the drawing board. We updated the clickable wireframe and tested with a few more people. They had the same questions but this time they found the answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t know what they want. That’s true. But they’ll know when something is missing. And you don’t want your product to be a bunch of features that completely miss what users want to do. Designers don’t know what people want. It’s not your job as a designer to know that by default. But it is your job to find out. If you’re designing for them, you have to know what their motivations are. Period. It’s not about the faster horses. It’s about the whys behind the faster horses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/09/21/breaking-through-a-creative-block/">&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you know these moments too. Working hard on something but not getting anywhere with it. Through all these years I found three approaches that help me through these moments. Most of the times they work. But sometimes they don’t and I ship average work, feel bad about it and can’t wait to get back and improve it. Anyway, here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;force-my-way-through-with-hard-work&quot;&gt;Force my way through with hard work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have I spent hours of work on a project that needed to be done yesterday but still wasn’t going anywhere. The feeling of frustration grows until you’re fed up and need a break. I usually do take a break but a short one. The work needs to be done in a few hours and there’s nothing left but force my way through. A few hours of hard work after already a few hours of hard work is incredibly tough. But sometimes it’s all that is left. It may produce above average work at best but it will be done. It’s important to leave your perfectionism out of it when you need to take this approach. Momentum is the other important part. Don’t take long breaks. Take more shorter ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-on-something-else&quot;&gt;Work on something else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach will only work if you have the luxury to postpone the work for a little while. Working on one thing for hours will narrow your focus and you won’t be able to see the big picture anymore. You might also need a different perspective on the work but after hours spent on it, you’re too heavily invested. You need to get away from the work and work on something else for a while. Spend an hour or even less trying to find a solution to another problem, then get back to the original task. You’ll fell slightly refreshed and more eager to continue the work. Smaller tasks are the best for intermediate shift of focus. Try to complete at least a few to motivate you even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep-on-it&quot;&gt;Sleep on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last approach is not for the rushed projects that need to be done on the same day. This will only work if you can get back to work on another day but might be the most effective. Our subconscious mind is more effective at finding patterns than the conscious one. After spending hours of hard work on a problem your brain will do you a favour of trying to find a solution while you sleep. That’s why it’s much better to study for an exam before you go to sleep, not in the morning just before the exam (tell that to the young version of me). You’ll have a better picture of the problem you’re trying to solve and sometimes even a solution. This approach is great for tougher problems that need time. Others use this approach quite effectively as well. The key is that you need to spend a few hours working hard on the problem. Maybe just before you go to sleep as well. Then let your brain do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/08/25/my-reading-process</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/08/25/my-reading-process/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-books&quot;&gt;Reading Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I keep a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11006629-matej-latin-latin&quot;&gt;to-read list on Goodreads.com&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever I encounter a book that I find interesting, I add it to this list (more than 400 items at the moment). Besides reading I also like to plan. I use Trello for all my planning. I split every year into quarters—periods of three months. Then I write down all the books that I want to read in the upcoming period and create a checklist. With a goal of 40 books per year that’s 10 books per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the actual reading of the book. I always keep a pencil with me—when reading a book in physical form—to make notes. Simple underlining and marking with an exclamation mark does the trick. I never write actual notes. I may, sometimes, add small page indicator stickers to the page where I make a note. This way I can come back to it in just a few seconds. I tend to do that only with technical and detailed books. Especially the ones I know I’ll be coming back to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-articles&quot;&gt;Reading Articles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so much content on the web. It’s hard to keep up with it and even daunting at times. I’m signed up to a few newsletters, some weekly, some daily. That’s where I find most of the content that I want to read online. I want reliable, high-quality content. So far, curated newsletters were the only ones that met my criteria. I tend to open a link from Twitter every now and then but I always take those with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, whatever I find interesting goes to my to-read list. This one I keep at Instapaper. I never read these articles right after finding them. They always go to this list and I read them when I have time. Unlike for books, I don’t have a designated time for reading articles. It takes me 5–10 minutes to read most of them so they’re great for quick reads during snack time or something similar. I archive all the articles I read so the to-read list stays clean (kinda makes me feel good to have an almost empty to-read list).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weekly-reading-review&quot;&gt;Weekly Reading Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to write book reviews. A short recap with a simple goal. Go through the book again and review my own notes and underlinings. I learned much more from a book this way than just reading it once. I would then publish these reviews on my website. The process was too long and because of that it failed its purpose. So I decided to keep doing that but keep these notes private. This way I can keep them quick and dirty but just enough so I can get back to them later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now do this in my “weekly reading review”—whenever I actually have time to have one. I sit down, take a look at the book and articles that I read that week. I focus on my notes and write a short recap. The recap is not even made of actual sentences. Bullet lists mostly. But it’s enough for me to be able to get back and just enough so what I read actually sticks in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this systematic process of reading to work well for me. Am I taking it too far? Do you have a similar approach to reading? Share your thoughts with me.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/08/18/i-quit-design-twice/">&lt;p&gt;The last thing I remember I wanted to be was a “game designer/developer”. I just got my first PC and playing video games was all I did. Then, at some point, I had stopped thinking about what I really wanted to do. I guess the “life auto–pilot” must have kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I still look back on those years as one of the best years of my life. Video games, music and candy—bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;force-indent&quot;&gt;
Primary school was a piece of cake, but high school was a wake up call. I spent most of my time playing video games, neglecting school assignments. I’d come home, turn on the PC and start playing Half-Life, Command &amp;amp; Conquer, Civilization. All those games were so time consuming. There was no time for anything else. My grades in school started to reflect this and I failed a class. The next year I dropped out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was something else I used my PC for. I was designing websites and setting up eCommerce sites for local clients. I picked up this interest as a child but I had never thought it’d ever be anything more than a hobby. I was setting up WordPress blogs, Zen Cart web sites and drawing interfaces and websites in Photoshop by the time I finally finished high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-time-to-get-serious&quot;&gt;It’s time to get serious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After high school, just like almost anyone at my age, I went to study at a local university. “You’ll need a degree to have the slightest chances to get a job” was what everyone kept telling me. Ok, it’s probably time to get my shit together and make something of myself, is what I thought to myself. I decided to stop all the web design I had been doing and focus solely on studying. I enjoyed designing websites but it was time to quit. It was time to start focusing on what mattered in life: get a degree, get a job, earn money and everything will be alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A degree → a “proper job” → money → everything’s alright&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a load of bullshit. I couldn’t stay away from designing websites. By that time, I wasn’t playing video games that much anymore. I unawarely started enjoying web design more. Studying didn’t suffer at all, as I finished top of the class, but now it was time to find a “proper” job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-a-proper-job&quot;&gt;Getting a “proper” job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d just wrapped up studying and I was left with a degree that would secure me a good job. I actually believed that. But nobody wanted a clueless twenty-something guy who was fresh out of university so finding a “proper” job proved impossible. At some point I became so desperate, that I just wanted to start working at a local electronics shop but even they didn’t want me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, I finally got a job. It was the best job in the shithole town where I come from. The best in terms of what a guy like me could wish for.  So I became a Business Process Manager at a local bank which is a part of a large, global group. I had been running my own company until then, doing what I always did—web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I really had to quit design this time. The corporation where I worked at required me to do so. I wasn’t allowed to run my own company and be employed there at the same time. Alright, no problem with that. I got the best job around, it’s time to fully commit to it. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, life isn’t so easy and it certainly isn’t so simple. The problem was that I hated my new job. I couldn’t stand working at that place. But what do I do? This is what I’m supposed to do, right? Get a degree, check. Get a good, well paid job, check. Be happy? Was I just extremely selfish for wanting more? Should I just get over myself, be happy with what I had and get used to the fact that my job doesn’t make me happy? That it actually makes me miserable? Stressed out? Anxious? How do other people accept this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I restarted doing web design work for clients a few months after I started working at that bank. It was the only thing that brought some happiness in my life. At least when I was designing and building websites I didn’t feel inadequate. I didn’t feel out of place. I tried quitting it twice but for some reason it stuck with me so I said to myself “fuck it, I’ll commit to it 100% this time”. I quit my well paid job and decided to go back freelancing, just like I did before. I was presented with an opportunity to join Wondermags, a Luxembourgish startup, a week later. This was going to be my first in-house design role. The rest is history but it turned out well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do what you love → Money → Everything’s alright&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson of my story: don’t quit what you’re good at. Especially if it makes you happy. Commit to it 100%, no matter what and everything will be alright. Forget everyone else. Forget the money. If you do what you love, the money will follow somehow. If anyone tells you otherwise, ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/08/11/ux-is-not</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/08/11/ux-is-not/">&lt;p&gt;Let’s do a quick test. Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://adriengervaix.com/&quot;&gt;following website&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look around. Spend a minute or two on the site. Even a few if you wish. There is no particular information that you should be looking for no task. Already back? Cool. Now try to answer the following questions based on the information that you were able to get from that website. Don’t worry if you’re not a UX designer or a designer at all. In fact, that’s even better. Write down the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is Adrien Gervaix and what does he do?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What specific project that he worked on do you remember? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Based on his case studies, what specific tasks does he do on a daily basis as a UX/UI designer?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Again, based on his case studies, what would you say UX design is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done? Let me know your answers. I’d love to see your conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this quick test is the ever reinforced misconception of what UX and UX design is. I understand that people (like myself) are thought UX designers, UI designers, developers etc. And there’s no problem with that. thought people need a strong passion to drive them forward. But passion alone is not enough. There needs to be something or someone to guide them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to stop thinking about UX design as static, possibly beautifully designed wireframes and animations. Yes, UX is about wireframes and it is about animations. But it’s much more than that. It’s everything between a sketch on the paper and a fully working beautifully designed product that people enjoy using. They do so because it brings them value. Not because they enjoy the animations or pretty illustrations in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animations and a nice visual design can enhance a user experience but they alone can’t be one.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrien’s portfolio website looks great. Aesthetically, I love it! But Adrien has, as he explained here, spent months working on it, (possibly) without asking for feedback in the process. Not to mention that navigation (one of the key elements of UX) is broken and becomes a real pain in the ass after a minute of navigating through the site. Besides, the only UX tool he uses are wireframes. And even those are too pretty to serve their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a website like that will get him lots of cool projects to work on but it won’t be the real kind of UX projects. And that’s bad for the company that he’ll work with, for him and for all the UX designers out there. Because it’s information like this that paints the wrong picture about what UX is. It’s so sad that even these days I still meet a lot of people, designers and non-designers alike, that think that what I do as a UX designer is wireframes and animations. Here’s an overview of what UX design truly is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ux-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;The elements of user experience&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The elements of user experience (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uxbeginner.com/ux-essentials-lesson-1-defining-user-experience-design/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian may be early in his design career. And he really seems like a talented designer. But he’ll need to learn a lot more before he can call himself a UX designer. Don’t worry. I called myself a UX/UI designer way too early too. I did some wireframes and put visual designs on top of that. I thought I was doing UX work. Well… I wasn’t. I later learned that. I, just like a lot of designers out there, did that mistake. Don’t be one of them. Find out what UX really is. Join a course or at the very least, read a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1867.The_Elements_of_User_Experience?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true&quot;&gt;The Elements of User Experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

  “I don’t trust books like these”, said James. I was surprised by the blunt comment and replied with a short:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “Why not?”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “I don’t know… There’s something about the title that turns me off”, James replied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “Maybe it’s the cover in general…”, he tried to elaborate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “It looks cheap right?”, Sarah joined the conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “How can a book look cheap”, I replied in astonishment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “I don’t know… it looks… self-published?”, she tried to explain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “Self-published? But it’s a book by O’Reilly…”, I interrupted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “I know, but still…”, Sarah didn’t know what else to say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “I kinda like the cover…”, I remarked,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
  “…it even has a big red heart on it”, I chuckled as I finished my thought, picking up the book, taking a closer look and briefly showing it to James and Sarah.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I remember a short conversation I had at work not long ago. I was a bit shocked by my colleagues’ bluntness and how quickly they judged the book that had been laying on my desk—Designing Products People Love by Scott Hurff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t been reading the book at that point yet. I just saved it for later. That’s why I didn’t feel comfortable commenting the book that much. I just made a remark on the cover and, as I remember, that’s how the conversation ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally started reading the book. I’ve read four chapters and enjoyed every minute of it. I’d just wrapped up a chapter last Saturday when I put the book down and remembered the remarks made by my colleagues. I couldn’t help but think about how much they’re missing. I learned a lot by reading just those four chapters—about a third of the book—and they never will. Why? Because they were so eager to judge it by its cover. By its title. They have no idea who the author is and know nothing of his background. But they think they know better than him. They think they know it all. Doing what they do every day, safe in their small box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, they like to be in their small box. And they want to keep it small. It keeps them feeling safe and reassured. They know they’ll be fine as long as they’re in there. They don’t even want to know if the edges of the box can be moved. No way! Why would they risk expanding it? Who knows what’s out there? Maybe it’s something or someone that will make them feel uncomfortable. It may provoke them. It may make them feel vulnerable, not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all the reasons why I enjoy expanding my horizons. Yes, it feels scary and overwhelming sometimes. But it keeps me on the edge. It’s tiring but it’s worth it. I rather try something new and fail than keep doing that one thing I know well. Maybe a book really isn’t that good. Who knows? But I’ve never read a book that I hadn’t learned something (anything) from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People judge and they will judge. A funny thing is that judgment comes from past experiences and wisdom of a certain person. So people with little of those get stuck in a circle. They never get out of it and they continue to express their ungrounded judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all judge. Designers exist because people judge. Judgment is fundamental to us. It’s part of our evolution and who we are. But let’s at least expand our box first. This way we can judge a little better or maybe try not to judge at all until we experienced whatever it is that we’re judging.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title type="html">Tab zero</title>
      <link href="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/07/21/tab-zero/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tab zero" />

      <updated>2016-07-21T21:56:54+02:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/07/21/tab-zero</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/07/21/tab-zero/">&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/browser-tabs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lots of tabs = chaos&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Lots of tabs = chaos &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be that guy. I wasn’t as extreme as most other people I see. I tried to keep the open tabs to a reasonable level, so I could still see a part of the title next to the icon. That was my minimum. But even that was driving me crazy. I would keep those tabs open just because I ‘stored’ an article that I wanted to read. I’d ‘store’ things that I’d probably find useful in the future. I’d ‘store’ pretty much everything like this (I gave up on bookmarks a long time ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I realised that all this ‘storing’ made me unproductive. The more I piled on this stored items, the less likely I was to return to it and actually use anything from it. How come? I had no idea back then. I just really disliked having so many things open. Waiting there for me to do something with it. It started to turn into a mental burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more options we have, the less likely we’re to choose any of them—according to Barry Schwarz, the author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10639.The_Paradox_of_Choice?ac=1&amp;amp;from_search=true&quot;&gt;Paradox of Choice&lt;/a&gt;. People just aren’t good with making choices. All those ‘stored’ tabs presented options. Articles to read, things to use, videos to watch. The more I had ‘stored’, the less likely it was that I’d actually use anything ‘stored’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-tab-zero&quot;&gt;Enter Tab Zero&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve adopted the Inbox Zero strategy a while ago. It keeps my email tolerable and usable. If I have to do something with an email I leave it there until I do. If it’s done, I archive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t actually keep my inbox empty. I find extremisms like Inbox Zero more of a guidance than a rule. That’d become another tedious chore if I did. I don’t want that. So I came up with a similar strategy for keeping my open tabs to a minimum. I call it ‘Tab Zero’. Again, I don’t tend to close all the tabs in the browser—pinned tabs, for example, are open all the time (Trello, Confluence, Jira).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s an article I want to read but don’t have time, I save it to my Instapaper. If it’s something I want to share, I send it to Buffer. I find this to be liberating. A manageable number of tabs and storing other things where they actually have a place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, tools like Instapaper and Buffer help me keep those tabs to a minimum. The other problem with too many tabs being open is memory consumption. This had a major role in trying to solve my frustration with this problem. You know when Chrome crashes and you lose all those ‘stored’ items? I know. Pissed me off as well. But think about it again. It feels a bit liberating at the same time, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I started using a tool called Tab Suspender even before I adopted the Tab Zero strategy. It simply suspends any tab that is open for more than x time. You can refresh it and it will load again. It brings a massive improvement in memory consumption. You can find a few more tools, suggestions on solving this problem and an explanation of why exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.trello.com/too-many-browser-tabs&quot;&gt;many open tabs keep your brain ineffective on the Trello blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2016-07-14T21:56:54+02:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/07/14/adopting-a-habit</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/07/14/adopting-a-habit/">&lt;p&gt;I come from a small town where traffic jams are rare and public transport unneeded. Need to go to school? Take a short walk. Need to go to the supermarket? Take the car. Life was similar in Germany and Luxembourg. Whenever I needed to get somewhere it took me about 20 minutes. Not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is different. I’ve been adjusting since I moved here. Need to get somewhere? It’ll take me 40 minutes at least. And forget about going by car. Public transport is the best option. It takes me almost an hour to get to work and another hour to get back home. And yeah, that’s in the rush hour, when millions of other people try to do the same.
It’s this that made me rethink my routine and try to form a new habit. I’ve been getting up earlier than needed for at least two years now. I’d get up at 6, work out, take a shower, eat my breakfast, sit down for a few minutes and go to work. It all went well with the short commuting time because I was left with enough time to do what I want to do—read, work on my projects etc. But I now spend 2 hours just to get to work and back home. 2 hours out of 24 went out through the window. There’s not much I can do during that. So I decided to start getting up even earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep-less-work-even-more&quot;&gt;Sleep less, work (even) more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m now working on adopting a habit of getting up at 5 in the morning. One hour earlier than before. This way I have two extra hours every day which I usually spend working out and reading a book or writing (like, just now). It isn’t easy and it takes at least 21 days. &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesclear.com/new-habit&quot;&gt;Some studies suggest even more—closer to 2 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting how life changes. I was never keen on getting up early. I’d always get up as late as possible as a kid. I’d skip breakfast and run straight to school. I had probably played video games the night before, you know how it is: “just one more turn in Rome: Total War / Civilisation 3” and the sun is almost up :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say that I like getting up earlier. It’s peaceful, quiet and dark. Most of the world still sleeps while I work on whatever it is that I currently work on. It’s a bit hard to form a habit like this in the beginning but it’s definitely worth persisting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//personal-notes/2016/07/07/reading/">&lt;p&gt;I think it was about five books per year. It was mandatory. I would read these books in the first few years but when I think of it now, that wasn’t much of a reading. You know when you read something but your thoughts wander off and even though you read it you actually don’t? I found those books boring and by the end of the school I completely stopped reading them. Our teacher was extremely strict about it and she used to scare the shit out of me. But even that wasn’t a good enough reason to read. I remember thinking to myself: “How can people read books? I rather watch a film or play a video game. At least that’s not a complete waste of time, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 years later, everything is turned upside down. Now I read 3.5 books per month. That’s almost a book every week. I have a to-read list with more than 400 books on it and a goal to read 40 of them every year. I almost succeeded last year but fell short by 9. Moving to London completely disrupted my routine and I was unable to sustain such a rhythm for almost two months. Now, I think to myself: “How can people not read books?”. I stopped playing video games a while ago and I only watch a film every now and then. I read every day on my bus journey to work. I read while having lunch. Sometimes I even skip my morning exercise to read instead. I read them cover to cover. No skipping. For some unknown, strange reason, that feels like cheating to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what happened? To be honest, I have no idea. Maybe that ignorant kid simply grew up. At some point I started buying books and reading them. I believe it came from a desire to open my mind and get better at what I do—most books that I read are either design or typography related. It will take me 10 years to read all the books on my to-read list—assuming I can keep up the rhythm and that I don’t add more books to it (highly unlikely)—and I can’t wait to get through all of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2016/07/07/a-tale-of-a-colour-blind-designer</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2016/07/07/a-tale-of-a-colour-blind-designer/">&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“I don’t see it”, I muttered in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“How can you not see it? It’s right here: 12…”, my schoolmate claimed comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“I don’t see a 12, I see a 17…”, I replied in a growing frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/colour-blind-test.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember these tests? I don’t remember the exact numbers anymore, but I got most of them wrong anyway. We had these tests every now and then at school and I got used to failing them and listen to my schoolmates making fun of me. I think I was the only one that had this problem in my class. My schoolmates couldn’t understand how could I not se the number they were all seeing? They knew about colour blindness and they knew that I was colour blind but they still wouldn’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that colour blindness runs in our family. Mine is not a severe one—I mix colours that are very similar, like some shades of green and brown. This issue of mixing the colours became a real source of frustration trough the years. “Oh yeah, how could you see it? You’re colour blind…” was a usual response and a mockery of my disadvantage over others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to become a designer, I just became one. But how can a designer not see and mix colours? I drew Michael Jordan once as a kid and showed it to my grandma. “Why is he green?!”, she asked. “He’s green?!”, I replied in surprise. To me it looked ok. This memory was stuck in my head and I felt like a fraud sometimes—how can I work on design projects for clients if I can’t tell these basic colours apart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I started to move away from graphic design and branding projects and began to focus on UX/UI. My colour blindness wasn’t such an issue while working at this kind of projects so I could “hide” my disability. I would hide it because I still felt ashamed of it. Who would hire a designer that draws a green Michael Jordan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-perfect-job&quot;&gt;The Perfect Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, I was head of design at Wondermags. We were deciding on button colours and we had a few options. All of them had to work on a red background. We had a blue button and a green one for an interface of the iPad Kiosk app we were working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Shit, I can’t look at that!”, I commented the green button on a red background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Why not?”, Kurt (another designer on my team) asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“The contrast, it’s killing my eyes.”, I elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Really, I don’t see it”, he replied surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt then switched on the grayscale view on Skala Preview and it was immediately clear that the contrast between the button and the background was indeed bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“How did you know that?”, he asked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“I don’t know, must be because I’m colour blind…”, I replied, not knowing what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“You’re colour blind?!”, he asked surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Yeah…”, I replied as that feeling of frustration started to grow again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Ha… you have a perfect job!”, he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That comment blew my mind. Until then, I had always looked at my colour blindness as a disability. Like I couldn’t do something everyone else was able to do. But since that conversation, it started to feel more like a superpower actually. Hey, I can spot problematic colour combinations! I can see if the UI elements provide a good enough contrast even for the colour blind people like myself. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addressing-colour-blindness-in-uxui-design&quot;&gt;Addressing Colour Blindness in UX/UI Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 in 12 men is colour blind, according to the stats. This equals to 8% of the male population and 4.5% of overall population in Britain. That’s 2.7 million people just in UK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colour blindness is an accessibility issue that is probably the easiest to address. Still many designers ignore it. They don’t choose to do so, they just don’t think about it. It’s not like everyone has screwed up eyes like mine so they could spot these problems immediately. But there’s tools that can help everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, we used Skala View a lot. It comes with default filters to test the interface for different types of colour blindness. The one we used the most was the monochrome filter as we could spot contrast issues immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Sketch and have abandoned Photoshop a while ago. Sketch comes with a built-in tool for previewing interfaces on devices. Unfortunately it doesn’t have the filters to test for colour blindness. But don’t worry, there’s a cool alternative: &lt;a href=&quot;https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/&quot;&gt;Sim Daltonism&lt;/a&gt;. It’s open source and free. &lt;a href=&quot;http://colororacle.org/&quot;&gt;Colour Oracle&lt;/a&gt; is another one, also available for Windows. Both have smartphone apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <published>2016-01-25T20:56:54+01:00</published>
      <updated>2016-01-25T20:56:54+01:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2016/01/25/humane-typography-in-the-digital-age</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2016/01/25/humane-typography-in-the-digital-age/">&lt;p&gt;The machines of the industrial world finally took over the handicrafts. The typography of this industrial age was no longer handcrafted. Mass production and profit became more important. Quantity mattered more than the quality. The books and printed works in general lost a part of its humanity. The typefaces were not produced by craftsmen anymore. It was the machines printing and tying the books together now. The craftsmen had to let go of their craft and became a cog in the process. An extension of the industrial machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the victory of the industrialism didn’t mean that the craftsmen were completely extinct. The two worlds continued to coexist independently. Each recognising the good in the other — the power of industrialism and the humanity of craftsmanship. This was the second transition that would strip typography of a part of its humanity. We have to go 500 years back in time to meet the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-transition&quot;&gt;The first transition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar conflict emerged after the invention of the first printing press in Europe. Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type and used it to produce different compositions. His workshop could print up to 240 impressions per hour. Until then, the books were being copied by hand. All the books were handwritten and decorated with hand drawn ornaments and figures. A process of copying a book was long but each book, even a copy, was a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first printed books were, at first, perceived as inferior to the handwritten ones. They were smaller and cheaper to produce. Movable type provided the printers with flexibility that allowed them to print books in languages other than Latin. Gill describes the transition to industrialism as something that people needed and wanted. Something similar happened after the first printed books emerged. People wanted books in a language they understood and they wanted books they could take with them. They were hungry for knowledge and printed books satisfied this hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/42-bible.png&quot; alt=&quot;The 42-Line Bible, printed by Gutenberg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The 42-Line Bible, printed by Gutenberg &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, through this transition, the book lost a large part of its humanity. The machine took over most of the process but craftsmanship was still a part of it. The typefaces were cut manually by the first punch cutters. The paper was made by hand. The illustrations and ornaments were still being hand drawn. These were the remains of the craftsmanship that went almost extinct in the times of Eric Gill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-digital-age&quot;&gt;The digital age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first transition took away a large part of humanity from written communication. Industrialisation, the second transition described by Eric Gill, took away most of what was left. But it’s the third transition that stripped it naked. Typefaces are faceless these days. They’re just fonts on our computers. Hardly anyone knows their stories. Hardly anyone cares. Flicking through thousands of typefaces and finding the “right one” is a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.
&lt;cite&gt;— Massimo Vignelli&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typography is not about typefaces. It’s not about what looks best, it’s about what feels right. What communicates the message best. Typography, in its essence, is about the message. “Typographical design should perform optically what the speaker creates through voice and gesture of his thoughts.”, as El Lissitzky, a famous Russian typographer, put it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;loss-of-humanity-through-transitions&quot;&gt;Loss of humanity through transitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each transition took away a part of humanity from written language. Handwritten books being the most humane form and the digital typefaces being the least. Overuse of Helvetica is a good example. Messages are being told in a typeface just because it’s a safe option. It’s always there. Everyone knows it but yet, nobody knows it. Stop someone on the street and ask him what Helvetica is? Ask a designer the same question. Ask him where it came from, when, why and who designed it. Most of them will fail to answer these questions. Most of them used it in their precious projects but they still don’t spot it in the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the quality of a typeface is of the greatest importance for the functional, aesthetic and psychological effect.
&lt;cite&gt;— Josef Mueller–Brockmann&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typefaces don’t look handmade these days. And that’s all right. They don’t have to. Industrialism took that away from them and we’re fine with it. We’ve traded that part of humanity for a process that produces more books that are easier to read. That can’t be bad. And it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Humane typography will often be comparatively rough and even uncouth; but while a certain uncouthness does not seriously matter in humane works, uncouthness has no excuse whatever in the productions of the machine.
&lt;cite&gt;— Eric Gill&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve come close to “perfection” in the last five centuries. The letters are crisp and without rough edges. We print our compositions with high –precision printers on a high quality, machine made paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;full-bleed-image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/type-through-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;Type through 5 centuries.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Type through 5 centuries. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost a part of ourselves because of this chase after perfection. We forgot about the craftsmanship along the way. And the worst part is that we don’t care. The transition to the digital age made that clear. We choose typefaces like clueless zombies. There’s no meaning in our work. Type sizes, leading, margins… It’s all just a few clicks or lines of code. The message isn’t important anymore. There’s no more “why” behind the “what”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chasing-perfection&quot;&gt;Chasing perfection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. In what way will the message be communicated best? What typeface should we use and why? Does the typeface match the message and what we want to communicate with it? What will be the leading and why? Will there be more typefaces in our design? On what ground will they be combined? What makes our design unique and why? This is the part of humanity that is left in typography. It might be the last part. Are we really going to give it up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography needs to be audible. Typography needs to be felt. Typography needs to be experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Helmud Schmid&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2015/12/23/kebab-shop-ux</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2015/12/23/kebab-shop-ux/">&lt;p&gt;The owner of the shop is very friendly. He speaks a dozen of languages but always greets me in English as soon as I walk in (he already knows that I don’t speak either French or German — both used in Luxembourg). He offered to shake my hand as he always does and asked how I was doing. I replied with my usual: “I’m OK”, and smiled. At this moment he noticed my book. He must have read the title because he asked me what is it that I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;conversation&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“I’m a user experience designer…”, I replied, expecting a follow–up question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“A user experience designer? What’s that?”, he asked, as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“I design user experiences…” I started my reply as I was trying to think of an example to explain it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“OK, but what do you mean by… user experience?”, he asked again even before I was able to came up with my example. At that moment I realized. There was a perfect example right in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“You see this?”, I asked while trying to point to the interaction we were having using my hand…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“This is similar to a user experience”, I continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was silent and waiting for me to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Us, having this chat, you greeting me in English straight–away, offering me a hand shake and asking me how I was… This is a user experience…”, I began to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Followed up by a great product that I keep coming here for, means that I have an enjoyable overall user experience every time I come over”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked at me with an expression of surprise on his face as he asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“There’s jobs where you design this?!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a business owner, coming from an eastern culture, he couldn’t understand that what he does in his everyday with every customer has to be designed. For him, all this comes naturally. No fake smiles, no fake attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole experience made me think. The more I thought about it, the more I was coming to a conclusion that a good user experience isn’t something that can be designed. It’s something that has to be embedded in the culture from which the product is coming from. It has to be embedded into the group of people behind the product. We can design ways to introduce the right way of thinking towards providing a good experience but the desire for providing a good experience has to come naturally. The only thing worse than a bad user experience is a fake user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2015/06/01/creating-products-users-love</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2015/06/01/creating-products-users-love/">&lt;p&gt;We were invited to this event because Wondermags is a Luxembourgish startup and we put a lot of effort in user experience. I must admit, it feels good to have such reputation. Anyway, I was asked to present our approach to creating products that users love. Here’s what I presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-01.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The guy in red is me&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The guy in red is me &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short introduction to Wondermags, the team and what our goal is, I tried to explain what UX design actually is. As I mentioned earlier, the audience was composed of fresh businessmen and students, so I wasn’t expecting that they would be familiar with this term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ux-design-oversimplified&quot;&gt;UX Design, Oversimplified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reminded the audience that the explanation that I was about to present is simplified. Calling it oversimplified would be more appropriate, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the intersection of user needs and company needs, value goes both ways. That’s when great user experiences happen.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;In the intersection of user needs and company needs, value goes both ways. That’s when great user experiences happen. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have users with their needs, problems and goals on one side. And we also have a company with its own needs, problems and goals on the other side. The company believes that there is a group of users with a problem that they decided to try to solve. So a solution (in a form of a product) is provided to the users. This solution should meet the needs and solve problems on both sides. When that happens, value goes both ways. The users are provided with a product that solves their problems, and the company successfully monetizes the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, UX design is not only about the users, it’s about the company and its business goals as well. If it can’t reach its business goals, it will eventually go out of business and therefore become unable to continue to provide the solution for the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-keys-to-creating-products-that-users-love&quot;&gt;3 Keys to Creating Products That Users Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my work at Wondermags, I wanted to present 3 keys that I believe are crucial to creating the products users love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time when I joined a new team or project as a UX designer, I asked the person in charge: “OK, who’s the product for?… Who will use the product?”. And almost every time the response was a surprise, because of asking such an absurd question (to them), followed by something like: “What do you mean? We want everyone to use our product!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook now has the largest population on Earth.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook now has the largest population on Earth. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon the tweet above when I was working on this presentation. I decided to put it in because it illustrates my point so clearly. Facebook now has the largest population on Earth. If you work for Facebook, than you can say that everyone is your user. Even grandpas and grandmas use it these days. But, until then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-04.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t make everybody happy. Especially not, when you’re a startup with limited resources. This leads me to my first key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-define-your-users&quot;&gt;1 Define Your Users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a group of users that you want to focus on. What problems do these users have? Are they aware of this problems that you’re trying to solve? If they are, are they already solving it? How are they solving it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write down all the potential groups that could use your product and choose two of them that you think makes the most sense to focus on first. Write all you assumptions and hypothesis down. The coolest way to do this so far are the UX personas. We took the Lean UX approach to this and had prepared the two personas in one evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-05.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Anna the blogger and Andreas the editor are the two wondermags personas so far.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Anna the blogger and Andreas the editor are the two wondermags personas so far. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we know which users we want to focus first and what their problems are. So, let’s just give them a solution, right? It’s not so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-know-your-users&quot;&gt;2 Know Your Users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know who we want to focus on first, we have to validate our assumptions that we have of them and their problems. And the only way to really do that, is to communicate with the users. Find out if they have the problem that you’re trying to solve and if they’re already solving it. If they are, ask them to show you how. Don’t just trust what users tell you, focus more on observing their actions. What users say they do is not always what they really do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing them, while they’re solving the problem that you want to solve with your product, will give you further insights about your users. You may notice that they struggle at a certain point of their current solution. This can provide you with ideas on how to solve the problem better or even what to avoid when creating your own solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-06.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Our very first usability test.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our very first usability test. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communication with the users has to be ongoing throughout the lifecycle of the product. The photo above is of us, doing the usability tests just when we were getting ready to start with the private beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/love-07.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Usability tests reports.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Usability tests reports. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these usability tests were, I would say average. Our Editor, which is the tool to create the magazines, was still very buggy. It was so buggy that it was kinda hard to use. But for some features, our users got a big smile on their face and went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, that’s so cool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;The Wow Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-exceed-user-expectations&quot;&gt;3 Exceed User Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical term for these moments is The Wow Moment. These moments will tell you when you have succeeded in exceeding user expectations, which is the third and final key to creating products that users love. You will be able to do so only if you truly know your users. Defining the ones you want to focus on and communicating with them serve as means to your goal: to exceed their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their expectations may be exceeded by providing a simpler and more effective solution, a fun solution or a solution to a problem that they didn’t even know that they had. That’s why observing them is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that great products are not built for the users, they’re built with the users. Defining your users will let you know who you need to communicate with to find out more about their problems and to really get to know them. Exceeding their expectations are those delightful moments that makes them love and actually use your product. What’s a product good for if no one needs it, or even worse, no one wants it?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title type="html">A designer’s Sublime Text setup</title>
      <link href="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2014/12/07/a-designers-sublime-text-setup/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A designer’s Sublime Text setup" />
      <published>2014-12-07T20:56:54+01:00</published>
      <updated>2014-12-07T20:56:54+01:00</updated>
      <id>https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2014/12/07/a-designers-sublime-text-setup</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2014/12/07/a-designers-sublime-text-setup/">&lt;p&gt;I truly believe in and appreciate simplicity. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/16/user-total-control-designers-nightmare/&quot;&gt;simple tools that allow customisation&lt;/a&gt; for power users. On a Windows PC, Notepad++ somehow provided that. To be honest, I wasn’t even a power user back then, so customisation wasn’t a priority. I just needed a very simple text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-search-for-a-new-text-editor&quot;&gt;In search for a new text editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I switched to a Mac a few years ago. After doing so, I realised that Notepad++ is not available on OSX. That was the reason to start searching for a new text editor that would be somehow similar to what I was used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search provided me with options like Brackets, Coda, TextMate, TextWrangler, BBEdit 10, Aquamacs, Espresso and Sublime Text. There’s a wide range of these and I tried most of them. In the end, I decided to give Brackets a proper try. It’s free and has live reload on document change already built-in. That was something I really appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using Brackets when it was still in beta. And it was obvious. It had some disturbing bugs but what really bothered me was the performance. Sometimes it got to a point when even scrolling through an HTML document would produce lag. I had none of it and decided to give another text editor a try. For some reason, Sublime Text looked the most promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-text-editor-youll-fall-in-love-with&quot;&gt;The text editor you’ll fall in love with&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you install Sublime Text you get something that looks very simple in both UI and functionalities. At first, it doesn’t look that special actually. Why would someone pay $70 for this? But once again, Google has all the answers you need. After taking some time to really get the essence of Sublime Text, I fell in love with it. Here’s my setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrade-to-sublime-text3&quot;&gt;Upgrade to Sublime Text 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, you should update to the Sublime Text 3. It’s still in beta but works very well, and package support is also very good. There’s no major difference between the two. At least not on the first sight. But because of numerous updates under the hood, the performance is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure whether to upgrade or not, give this tool a try. It will tell you if you’re ready to upgrade, determined by the support for the packages that you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sublime-01.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Detailed instructions on how to use this tool are included on the website.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Detailed instructions on how to use this tool are included on the website. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I had all green, so I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-package-control&quot;&gt;Install package control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I install the Package Control. Without it, it would be much harder and time-consuming to customise Sublime Text. Installation is very simple and quick. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/installation&quot;&gt;Check the instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have that installed, you’re able to install all the expansion packages right from Sublime Text so you don’t have to manually download and install them. It’s a timesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theme--color-scheme&quot;&gt;Theme &amp;amp; color scheme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a successful upgrade, I immediately started looking for a cool theme. I need my text editor to look slick and minimalistic. And I really wanted to get rid of that old, Windows Vista like look that Sublime Text comes with by default. To get rid of it, you have to change the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sublime-02.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;This is what Sublime Text looks like right after installation.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This is what Sublime Text looks like right after installation. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme is not the same as colour scheme&lt;/strong&gt;. The former defines the looks of Sublime text window, sidebar, tabs and modal windows and the latter defines the background and syntax highlight colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular theme I really like, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/&quot;&gt;Space Gray&lt;/a&gt;. I found it after searching for quite some time. I narrowed my options to this and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion&quot;&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. Both look very good, both very close to what I like. In the end, I decided to go with Space Gray and I’m sticking with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even more colour schemes than themes for Sublime Text. There’s a cool website with a lot of them: &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorsublime.com/&quot;&gt;Colorsublime&lt;/a&gt;. I like the base16-ocean so I just stick with it. It gives me just the right amount of contrast so my eyes don’t suffer too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I event went further and removed the arrows that are meant for navigation through the tabs. This might come handy when you have a gazillion of tabs open. But I got used to switching between them with the Alt + Cmd + left/right arrows shortcut. So for me, those arrows were just visual clutter and I removed them. To do so you have to add this line into your user settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“enable_tab_scrolling”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sublime-03.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;My final result: clean &amp;amp; minimalistic, without any visual clutter.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My final result: clean &amp;amp; minimalistic, without any visual clutter. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personalisation&quot;&gt;Personalisation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I was using Brackets for some time. Not long, but long enough to get used to some keyboard shortcuts. The two I used the most that had different key bindings from Sublime were delete line and duplicate line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After switching to Sublime Text, I noticed that the duplicate line shortcut from Brackets had the opposite effect in Sublime: it deleted the line. So I decided to add my own custom keyboard shortcuts. And in Sublime that’s very easy. These can be added/edited in &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Key Bindings — User&lt;/strong&gt;. Whatever custom shortcut you add there will overwrite the default one. In my case they were these two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“keys”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“super+d”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“command”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“duplicate_line”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“keys”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“super+shift+d”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“command”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“run_macro_file”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“args”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“file”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“Packages/Default/Delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;Line.sublime-macro”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate scrolling horizontally, so I wanted Word wrap to be enabled by default. Another search on Google, gave me an answer in less than a minute. I just had to add this line to my &lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Settings — User&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“word_wrap”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, every time I create/open a new document, the word wrap will be enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;packages&quot;&gt;Packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to repeat myself so this is a list of additional packages to the ones I mention in other parts of this article (themes and Package Syncing later on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Alignment&quot;&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Top 25 packages for Sublime. It provides easy alignment of multiple selections and multi-line selections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Autoprefixer&quot;&gt;Autoprefixer&lt;/a&gt; is also a very popular package. When you run it, it adds the vendor prefixes to you CSS. Ain’t nobody got time for messing with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/BracketHighlighter&quot;&gt;BracketHighlighter&lt;/a&gt; marks the opening and the closing bracket of the current line of code. Sometimes, this comes very handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Can%20I%20Use&quot;&gt;Can I Use&lt;/a&gt; adds a shortcut to your key bindings with which you can quickly check how well is a CSS property supported by browsers. This one goes &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; to check for that. There’s also a package that provides this offline — &lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/caniuse_local&quot;&gt;caniuse_local&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/CSScomb&quot;&gt;CSScomb&lt;/a&gt; makes your code beautiful. Now you can do it very quickly with this package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet&quot;&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt; is like magic for your coding. Once you get the hang of it, you will save time. A lot of time. Just write an “equation” of your code, press tab, and there it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet%20Css%20Snippets&quot;&gt;Emmet CSS Snippets&lt;/a&gt; the same as Emmet but this time for CSS (including LESS and SASS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/LiveReload&quot;&gt;LiveReload&lt;/a&gt; refreshes the website you’re working on when you make a change to the source code. I got used to this behaviour when I was using Brackets and really liked it. Another time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SCSS&quot;&gt;SCSS&lt;/a&gt; adds syntax highlight for the .scss files. I recently decided to learn to use CSS preprocessing, so I need this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SideBarEnhancements&quot;&gt;SideBarEnhancements&lt;/a&gt; makes the sidebar in Sublime more useful. It adds some basic functions: new file/folder, edit, open/run, reveal, find in selected/parent/project, cut, copy, paste, paste in parent, rename, move, delete, refresh…. and also some advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/TrailingSpaces&quot;&gt;TrailingSpaces&lt;/a&gt; highlights all the trailing spaces in your code. It can also remove all trailing spaces with one action. What’s wrong with having trailing spaces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;package-syncing&quot;&gt;Package syncing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Sublime Text installed on two machines: my personal MacBook and my iMac at work. No matter which machine I’m working on, I need my personal Sublime Text setup. I need it to look exactly the same with all the packages on both machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping both installations in sync manually is time-consuming. I did it for some time but got tired of it. After a while my two Sublime Text installations grew apart. I thought to myself: can’t there be a way to automatically sync the two installations of Sublime Text?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is! Or, there are, because there’s a bunch of them. The most popular would be to sync your installation with a little help from Dropbox (I don’t really like Dropbox so I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://mega.co.nz/&quot;&gt;MEGA&lt;/a&gt; instead). And there’s a package you can install that makes it very easy to set this up — &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/csch0/SublimeText-Package-Syncing&quot;&gt;Package Syncing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, when I install a new package on one of my machines, it will be automatically synced to the other. This also applies for all my settings and personalisations of Sublime Text. Neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;Icon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, nobody likes the default Sublime Text icon. That’s why there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/search?q=sublime+text%2C+icon&quot;&gt;so many alternatives available on Dribbble&lt;/a&gt;. I honestly never really had any problems with the default icon. I kinda liked it. But since the Yosemite UI switch to a flatter look, the default Icon didn’t match anymore. Yes, that’s the only reason I decided to change the icon. Designers, eh? :bowtie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sublime-04.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this icon. It keeps the original design of the Sublime Text icon but also looks great on latest OSX. You can get it &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/shots/1705218-Sublime-Text-Yosemite-Icon&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There are two reasons for this. The first is obvious: We are the ones who are supposed to know the principles of design and usability. Some of us were born with this feeling of what feels and looks right, while other designers have learned it — at least good designers eventually have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that, unlike users, we see the world in another way. We see what can be done to improve the things we use every day. For example, we might remember a restaurant not by its name or location, but by its poorly chosen typeface for the logo, as Tobias Frere-Jones recalls in the movie Helvetica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple words, &lt;strong&gt;designers should be the ones who know what’s right and should know how to fix it when it’s not&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2014/04/03/readopting-the-design-in-browser-approach/">&lt;p&gt;I got so used to designing (drawing) websites in Adobe Photoshop that I didn’t know where to start. Then I realized that I had already done it in the past with far worse tools then the ones we use now. Web design is not graphic design. It may consist of some of the elements of graphic design but it’s not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did we start drawing websites in Photoshop in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened-to-web-design&quot;&gt;What Happened to Web Design?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find an answer we have to go back to the definition and the core of web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started taking interest in web design all we had was Notepad to work with. We learned the basics of HTML and designed websites with just that. Later CSS came along, so we learned and started using it. What else do you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that simple. Websites started to evolve. More and more, we started using graphics to enhance websites and make them prettier. Higher bandwidth speeds made that possible. Soon, PHP, ASP, SQL, CMS, SEO, JavaScript and Flash animations all became a part of the web design we know today. It became too much for a web designer to have all the knowledge needed to build a website from scratch. So we divided the role like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/designing-in-browser.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Web design roles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We killed the web designer. We replaced him with a graphic designer that had to draw the website design in Photoshop and send it to a web developer to start transforming the PSD to HTML and CSS. Consequently, the web designer forgot how to code and started drawing most of the time. He drew all the pages of the website and all the interactions and website elements in Photoshop. He drew lines, backgrounds, images text and other typographic elements. He drew everything. It’s easy to draw a pretty website in Photoshop once you master the tool. It was up to the web developers to actually build the website, based on those drawings. We ended up with an overcomplicated process that either didn’t bring the best results or took a very long time to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://matejlatin.github.io/matejlatin.co.uk//articles/2013/12/09/geometry-in-ui-design/">&lt;p&gt;Aligning interface elements in Photoshop is pretty easy as it comes with the pre-defined aligning options. And for the 95% those are all you really need. What can you do in those 5% examples when you can’t use these options? Well, it actually depends a lot on what you’re working on. Let’s see a specific example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aligning-an-icon-to-the-center-of&quot;&gt;Aligning an icon to the center of…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the quarter of a circle. This was my most recent example when I had to use geometry to get that pixel perfect UI element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working on a confirmation window, which was inside a circle. Yes, we’re trying out all sorts of cool stuff at Wondermags. What we want to do is ask the user if he’s sure of the action he’s about to execute. We give him an explanation of what will happen and options to confirm or cancel.
Here’s a quick sketch for this window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-01.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A very rough sketch :)&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A very rough sketch :) &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the problem we’re trying to solve here is how to properly align the two icons to the center of each of the buttons at the bottom half (confirm and cancel). If you use the align to vertical and align to horizontal center in Photoshop, this is what you’ll get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Icons are not properly aligned to the actual center of the buttons.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Icons are not properly aligned to the actual center of the buttons. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this doesn’t look right at all and it certainly looks very strange to say the least. Photoshop aligns it like this because it still treats it as a rectangle, not a quarter of the circle (there’s no difference for Photoshop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;For Photoshop, this is still a rectangle.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;For Photoshop, this is still a rectangle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;square-area-is-the-answer&quot;&gt;Square area is the answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, what would be the easiest and most precise way to align it right to the actual center. Here’s where geometry comes handy. I figured that the key here could be the square area of the quarter of the circle. All I had to do is calculate the square area of it and draw a rectangle with the same square area to use as a guide. But first, I had to find out what dimensions I had to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-04.png&quot; alt=&quot;This is the square area that interests me (dashed area).&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the square area that interests me (dashed area). &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula for calculating square area of a circle is A=π*r^2. But in my case I was only using quarter of the circle. So my formula was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A = π * r^2 / 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;π is a standard which is 3.1416 and r is the radius, which in my case is 145 pixels (also half of the width of the circle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the calculations and the square area of the rectangle I had to draw was 16,513 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the square area info doesn’t help me much. I can’t draw a rectangle in Photoshop so that I would set the square area of it. What I need is the width of the rectangle. And to get it, I just had to add the square root to my formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A = √(π * r^2 / 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is 128.5 and lots of decimals. Now I could draw a square on top of my quarter of the circle with width set to 128 pixels and align it to the top left corner. The center of this square is the actual center of my button. This is what my icon needs to be aligned to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-05.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rectangle with the same square area as the quarter of the circle.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rectangle with the same square area as the quarter of the circle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aligned the icon to the horizontal and vertical centers of the guide rectangle on top of my circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-06.png&quot; alt=&quot;Aligned the icon to the center of the guide square.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Aligned the icon to the center of the guide square. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied the same process for the other button and that’s it. Pixel perfect alignment, pixel perfect user interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-07.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pixel perfect UI.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel perfect UI. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the comparison of before and after:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/geometry-08.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Before and after: wrong and right.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Before and after: wrong and right. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to highlight two major points of this article. One is that geometry and mathematics in general can help you a lot in pixel perfect user interface design and web design. You just have to find the right way to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other one is that if you do something, do it properly. If you have to design an interface, go for the pixel perfection or don’t do it at all. This is what separates average interface designers from the best ones. Put some extra work in it, even more than necessary if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try, fail, think, learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
