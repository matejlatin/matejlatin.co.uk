&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd get to the office at around 8:30 am ‚Äì a bit early so I had some time to sort out my desk and check email. My first standup was at 9:20 am. This was the design standup which should have taken about 10 minutes but quite often extended to double its allocated time. I then had 20 minutes till the next standup at 10 am. This was the one that always started late and usually extended well over the allocated time. Right after that one, at 10:15 am was the next standup. This one usually took about 15 minutes to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

Not anymore and it‚Äôs because I decided to go back to working remotely. I spent the last five years getting up really early, commuting to work, attending standups, hurrying to meetings and hoping that I would be able to get some work done before time runs out. It‚Äôs a never ending struggle. No matter how optimistic you are, the number of meetings never really reduces. Commuting to an office, even if it‚Äôs just a 20-minute walk, can never be pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we lived in Greenwich, which is one of the nicest areas in London, I had to get up at 5 in the morning. I‚Äôm one of those that like to have a strong morning routine. Before I would always get up at 6 just so that I had one hour that I could spend either reading or exercising (it‚Äôs something that helps me remain sane no matter how much stress there is in my life). But this was the first time that I had to commute to an office in central London and it took around one hour.  I didn‚Äôt want to let go of my routine so it had to be moved because of that. Do I have to tell you that I never really managed to stick to it? 5 in the morning was simply to early. I only had 7 hours of sleep (on good nights) and it simply wasn‚Äôt enough. In the end, living in a nice area meant nothing because I never had time or energy to explore and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-cog-in-a-machine&quot;&gt;A cog in a machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commuting, not enough sleep, not being productive at work‚Ä¶ all these things meant that I had very little control over my life. By the time I got home I was completely spent, I had no energy to work on my personal projects. You don‚Äôt realise it at first but after a while, it hits you‚Äîyou‚Äôre nothing but a cog in a machine. You show up, react to ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù, but don‚Äôt stand out. If the cog doesn‚Äôt align well, the machine breaks down. And that‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs supposed to work‚Äîa cog‚Äôs job is not being extra productive, it‚Äôs fitting in and keep running things as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell are all these people doing? Sitting there, wasting their lives away‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember looking through the tall glass windows from the office that I used to work at. On one side, a gorgeous view of central London, dozens of similar glass buildings on the other. They were so close to ours that I could clearly see people sitting in rows of tables. I couldn‚Äôt help but think: ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;what the hell are all these people doing? Sitting there, wasting their lives away‚Ä¶.  Wait! Do they look at me and think the same thing? I‚Äôm sitting there, 8 hours every day with 100 other people distributed among the rows of desks.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù We‚Äôre all like chickens‚Äîsitting in rows and laying eggs until one day when we stop being useful because our eggs aren‚Äôt good enough anymore. We all know what happens then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years into it and I had enough. How the hell do people manage to do this for their whole lives? Fuck that, I don‚Äôt want to grow old and look back at all the things that could be but never were. All the years spent working my ass of but nothing to show for it. Something had to change and as it seems now, the solution was surprisingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-working-remotely-help&quot;&gt;How does working remotely help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had worked remotely before when I freelanced but it was never full-time. And it was never for a fully-remote company. The only difference in my routine is that now I actually manage to stick with it. I still get up early, exercise, read, get to work at the same time, have lunch at the same time and wrap up work at roughly the same time as well. Without commuting, I now have more energy to spend on actually working. In general, I have more time to spend with my family (my wife and our cat for now) and I also have enough energy to spend working on my own things in the evening‚Äîwithout burning out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No standups, few meetings and no need for my working hours to overlap with the colleagues from across the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for a company like GitLab also helps a lot. Because we work on a tool that helps people collaborate asynchronously, we‚Äôre encouraged to work asynchronously ourselves. That means no standups, only few meetings and unlike most remote companies, no need for my working hours to overlap with the colleagues from across the ocean. The other day I washed my car in the morning and it wasn‚Äôt a problem even though it took me a couple of hours (believe it or not, I really enjoy washing my car üòÖ). I‚Äôm now in the coffee shop writing this post and I‚Äôll go home shortly after and spend a few hours working and actually being productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is something I had before but I never really appreciated it until I experienced the other side. I started this journey through Europe five years ago, looking for a collaborative and engaging office environment but found the exact opposite. I had to go through that to realise that what I was looking for was something that I already had in the first place. A brick and mortar office doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you‚Äôll be in good company or productive. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt make work more enjoyable (in most cases it‚Äôs the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working remotely comes with its own set of challenges but can also give you a better control over your life. That‚Äôs something that really matters to me and that‚Äôs what ultimately lead me to make a decision to go back to working like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap, red bricks, tiny windows, wooden-fenced square gardens, every house is exactly the same as the one next to it. Wet soil from the morning rain as there‚Äôs no grass anywhere, it‚Äôs desolated with no signs of life at all. Just the grey clouds in the sky and the cold wind howling around the box-shaped houses. ‚ÄúBleak‚Äù is the perfect word to describe it. I have no idea how much it costs but it must be a couple of hundreds of thousands at least. I can‚Äôt help but see it as a sad place where dreams come to die. A place full of emotionally frustrated people whose best chance to live a dream is to live a broken dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a park in the middle of the town, clearly meant for children to play but nobody‚Äôs there. It looks like nobody ever was there at all. The few people that do live there are probably too busy commuting to London and their important jobs. Why even bother putting a park in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm on my way to Manchester but thousands of people ride this train the opposite way to spend 8‚Äì10 hours in London and come home exhausted and emotionally spent. I know how it feels because I was there. I used to spend one hour commuting each way. And the trains are not what you imagine they are. They don‚Äôt even feel like a train, they feel like being stuck in a can of fish. They‚Äôre crowded to the point where you‚Äôre standing with your bag in your hand and can‚Äôt even move your arms because there‚Äôs literally no room. The bag that only weights a couple of kilos becoming heavier with each second that passes by, sweat pouring down your forehead, all the way to the eyes but you can‚Äôt swipe it. You can‚Äôt move, you‚Äôre stuck. And just when you thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse, the train stops at London Bridge‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone of the busiest train stations in London. The train is completely full but there‚Äôs two times more people outside trying to board it. I get pushed further into the middle of the coach and I start fearing if I‚Äôll be able to get off when the train reaches my station. Every breath gets heavier as the smell inside the train intensifies. I feel someone breathing down my neck, I hear another person‚Äôs music even though I‚Äôm listening to my own. I thought at first it couldn‚Äôt get worse but it did. But it will get even worse as the train keeps stopping and more people push their way onboard. Young mothers with baby strollers, commuters with bicycles‚Ä¶ where are all these people coming from?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you lived here you‚Äôd be almost home? No thanks. I‚Äôm leaving London behind. It was a dream that turned out to be another broken dream. But broken dreams are there to teach us that what we want isn‚Äôt necessarily what we really need. And through that, we grow, we evolve and we mature. I‚Äôm thankful I tried living the London dream and I‚Äôm glad it turned out to be broken. Now I get to move to the next one. I refuse to live a life of frustrations, distractions and wasted time. A life of unexplored ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù. A life that is outside of my control.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Day-to-day" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html">If you lived here‚Ä¶ (Source)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I never studied design</title><link href="http://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2018/02/17/i-never-studied-design/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I never studied design" /><published>2018-02-17T09:56:54+00:00</published><updated>2018-02-17T09:56:54+00:00</updated><id>http://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2018/02/17/i-never-studied-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2018/02/17/i-never-studied-design/">&lt;p&gt;I come from a small, seaside town in Slovenia. By the time I finished high school I had already been designing and building websites for a couple of years. There was no digital design course in any of the faculties in Slovenia at the time so I decided to sign up for the Computer Science course in Ljubljana‚ÄîSlovenia‚Äôs capital. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but shortly after I started the course I realized that it wasn‚Äôt for me. Looking back now, I think I just wasn‚Äôt mature enough to see the potential in learning Java and stuff. So I dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropping out meant that I had to move back to my hometown and sign up for a course there. With a limited range of those available locally, I decided to study Management. Not because I had a dream of becoming a manager or an economist, it was simply the most generic option out there. And you know what they say‚Äîyou need a degree to even stand a chance to get a job. All this time I was still designing and building stuff. Not just websites, but user interfaces and user experiences as well. I started out being completely clueless what UX design actually is. Whenever I didn‚Äôt know something, I improvised, made mistakes and learned from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there was no course guiding me towards ‚Äúwhat I should be learning‚Äù I basically learned a bit of everything. I was frustrated by doing everything for my clients until I learned about the T-shaped skills at some point. I then decided to become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://matejlatin.co.uk/personal-notes/2017/08/06/specialised-generalist/&quot;&gt;specialised generalist&lt;/a&gt; and systematically develop my skills which included front-end development, writing, management, UX research so they would complement my UX/UI and visual design skills well. I was never happy doing just one step in the process and handing it over to the next person in line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a privilege of not being able to study design.&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it now, I believe I had a privilege of not being able to study design. Privilege because I had to learn everything I know by myself. It‚Äôs a privilege also because I had the passion for doing design driving me onward. So I actually ended up doing what I really love, it was never just a fling. It was, and still is a journey driven by excitement of creating things and a hunger for learning. It started out as a dream, a hobby even. I never planned on becoming a designer but at some point it became a dream. A dream that was up to me to fulfil. And in the end, it was a privilege because I didn‚Äôt follow an established path towards becoming a designer. I learned what I had to, to get the job done, not something that a professor threw into a course‚Äôs curriculum. It was never something I could take for granted, it was something I had to fight for. If I wanted to be a designer, I simply had to do what designers do. That‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Design" /><category term="Day-to-day" /><summary type="html">I come from a small, seaside town in Slovenia.

Reading has become such an integral part of my life that I don‚Äôt need to trick myself into doing it anymore (challenging myself to read that many books was a way to build a strong routine). Before that, I had to force myself to start reading a new book. Now, I can‚Äôt wait to dig into the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here‚Äôs a list of books that I read this year and really liked. They‚Äôre not sorted in any particular order and none of them is directly design-related. I would categorise most of them as books about productivity, entrepreneurship, business and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-100-startup&quot;&gt;The $100 Startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388254436l/18883826.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;By Chris Guillebeau&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;By Chris Guillebeau &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first book that I read immediately after the new year. I received a Kindle Paperwhite as a Christmas gift and this was the first book that I bought with it. I loved the book so much, that I read it in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Guillebeau (the author) is a guy in his early thirties and never had a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù. He wrote the book as he travelled around the world on his quest to visit every country. I believe that by the time he wrote the book, he managed to visit 175 nations.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is an inspiration. He manages to live a lifestyle he wants and be completely free. He tells stories of other ordinary people that managed to break free. Free of ‚Äúreal jobs‚Äù, free of office desks an cubicles, free of all the bullshit. It was this book that inspired me to finally make one of my ideas happen‚ÄîBetter Web Type. You don‚Äôt need a lot of money to start your business. You just need to get shit done. And if what you‚Äôre selling is helpful to people, they will buy. And you can prove that what you‚Äôre saying is valuable by giving away stuff for free. We‚Äôll get back to this concept later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key takeaway: That idea that has been on your mind for the past few years? Go on and do it. ‚ÄúWhat if it fails?‚Äù is probably lurking somewhere in your mind. But what if it doesn‚Äôt? There‚Äôs nothing to lose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGood is the enemy of great‚Äù‚Äîis the first sentence in this book. What a great start. I got this book for a couple of pounds on Amazon (used copy). It was a great investment in my understanding of business organisations and what makes the best ones stand out.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-1&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Collins and his team of researchers spent 5 years researching American companies that stood out in their fields. After 6,000 articles and 2,000 pages of interviews transcript they came up with a list of a dozen of truly great companies. But the really important part was that they had a theory about what made these companies great and wrote down 7 key contributing factors and explored them. Definitely recommend this one but I have to warn you: reading it, you might realise that you work for a shit company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key takeaway: Any company can become a great company but most don‚Äôt know how but even if they do, they‚Äôre afraid to face the inevitable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been wanting to read this one for a while but kinda dreaded it because it‚Äôs a huge, 600+ pages book. I worked for an early-stage startup at the time I added this book to my to-read list but I‚Äôm glad I kept putting it off. A few years later it helped me improve my process of validating what to do next with my personal projects.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-2&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the book that needs to be on your desk if you work in product design &amp;amp; development. Especially if you‚Äôre in a small team or maybe even by yourself. It will help you find out if there‚Äôs a market for the thing that you‚Äôre building. The process is basically split into two steps: customer discovery and customer validation. What I really liked about the edition of the book that I read was that it had sections dedicated to building digital products. I walked away with a much better understanding of how to approach building a product (or even a company), and many ideas I could put to test straight away.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key takeaway: You can find answers to pretty much anything by experimenting early and often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this book because I got it for ¬£1 through a Kindle promotion and because I liked the cover (yes, I judge books by their covers). I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from it but was pleasantly surprised. I was afraid it would fall into the category of self-help books which I generally dislike. Instead, it was a story that I could closely relate to.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-3&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, we‚Äôve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ‚ÄúFuck positivity,‚Äù Mark Manson says. There‚Äôs a lot of shit in the world and the more fucks we give about everything, the more miserable we‚Äôll be. Mark‚Äôs point is: there only so many things we can give a fuck about and we need to choose wisely what those things will be. Are your colleagues (schoolmates, whatever‚Ä¶) a bunch of morons who keep finding ways to pick on you? Fuck them. Are your parents selfish idiots to the point where they managed to ruin your childhood? Fuck them. Is the mainstream media trying to persuade you into believing that you‚Äôre in constant danger and the only thing that can help is buying (even) more stuff? Fuck them. Is your partner abusive, has a sense of entitlement of controlling your life and doesn‚Äôt let you live as you want? Fuck him too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark draws inspiration from minimalism, stoicism (which is something I‚Äôve been reading about a lot lately) and his personal life stories. By the end, I really felt like I knew him personally. A very interesting, inspiring read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key takeaway: You need to choose what‚Äôs important in your life and eliminate everything else. It‚Äôs hard to bring down a man who doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally stumbled upon this book while browsing on my Kindle. Amazon suggested this book to me and their suggestion was spot on. Better Web Type had been released for a couple of months already when I read this book. Reading it, I realised that I built exactly what was described in it‚Äîunawarely of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-so-good-about-it-4&quot;&gt;What‚Äôs so good about it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Lovell wrote this book based on his experience from building F2P (free-to-play) video games. But he manages to expand the book into other areas and does it well. His premises: build valuable things and give them away for free. Build a relationship with your customers based on trust and they‚Äôll be ready to spend a lot of money on things that matter to them. The concept is simple: get in a lot of users by giving away stuff for free. Most of them will never buy from you, the majority of those that will buy, will spend an average amount on things you sell. But there will be a small amount of diehard fans that will be willing to spend lots of cash on things that really matter to them‚Äîthat‚Äôs where the name‚Äî‚ÄúThe Curve‚Äù‚Äîcomes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Key takeaway: Build your customer relationship on trust and you‚Äôll never have trouble selling your product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it. These are my favourite 5 books of the 19 that I read this year. I hope that I gave you a few ideas on what to read next. What‚Äôs a cool book that you read this year? Can‚Äôt wait to see your recommendations in the comments below. :yum:&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Startup" /><category term="Productivity" /><category term="Day-to-day" /><summary type="html">Last year I challenged myself to read 40 books, this year, I skipped that challenge. Reading has become such an integral part of my life that I don‚Äôt need to trick myself into doing it anymore (challenging myself to read that many books was a way to build a strong routine). Before that, I had to force myself to start reading a new book.

I found myself on the hiring side numerous times already and although a bit disrespectful, the article genuinely offers good advice for designers that are just starting out. Finding and hiring good designers is hard and yes, companies get all sorts of applications. There‚Äôs simply a lot of it to get through‚Äîmany people out there trying to start their design career.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the mentioned article, I wanted to look at how companies get things wrong in the design hiring process because, well, there are a lot of them that do it poorly. It‚Äôs not as one-sided as it looks, or as some would want you to think.The things in my list are mostly based on my own experiences or inspired by stories other designers told me. 6 things that I hate about your design recruitment, here¬†goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-a-generic-job-description&quot;&gt;1. A generic job description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you want to receive good-quality applications, write a decent job description. Don‚Äôt take one you find online, make a few changes and expect miracles. Describe what the role is, where it fits in and what is expected of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For remote positions: If your team is distributed but, for example, you‚Äôre US-based, write specifically if people applying should be US-based as well. Many companies don‚Äôt take the time to do this which results in a huge waste of time‚Äîon both sides.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put out a shit job description, expect shit applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-lack-of-respect-towards-the-candidates&quot;&gt;2. Lack of respect towards the candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once applied to a Product Designer role in a well-known company (I won‚Äôt mention any names in this article). It wasn‚Äôt just a regular application, I had a connection inside the company and I was told by that person that he‚Äôll make sure my application is taken seriously. It turned out I had to wait almost two months to get feedback, where they asked me for more work examples. After I prepared and sent that through, I received a short email from their recruiter. In it, she said that they wanted to invite me to a full-day interview at their headquarters and included a schedule.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I haven‚Äôt spoken to anyone from the company. That email was literally all I heard from them. So I asked: ‚Äúcan you tell me at what stage of the recruitment process am I and would there be another stage after the full-day interview?‚Äù After that I finally had a proper chat with the recruiter. In the end, based on the information she gave me, I decided not to proceed with my application for personal reasons. I sent an email to the recruiter explaining that and received no reply ever since.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a typical ‚Äúcompany with an attitude‚Äù as I started calling them. Dealing with them, I felt like they were doing me a favour for even considering me as a candidate for the job, instead of making me feel welcome.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-treating-candidates-likenumbers&quot;&gt;3. Treating candidates like¬†numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ‚Äúwell-known‚Äù company. Probably the biggest in the world when it comes to how many designers they have. It all started quite well, the recruiter genuinely seemed to be interested in me as a person. All seemed well-structured, too. Interview with the recruiter first, two one-hour interviews second and another final interview after that. They booked my two interviews for the second stage‚Äîeach with a different product designer. They let me know the schedule and who I‚Äôd be interviewing with.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, I researched the two designers I was supposed to interview with but didn‚Äôt help at all. Why? Well, because I was told on the day of the interview that the two designers were unavailable and that I‚Äôd have the interview with two other people.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ok, I was taken to this small, windowless room. Only a small desk and two chairs were inside. It was so small that nothing else would fit anyway. So small in fact that it made me feel uncomfortable. I had a brief chat with the recruiter who gave me some quick advice and then left as the person for the first interview arrived. I had 45 minutes to present two of my projects and a couple of minutes for a few questions. Immediately after that, the second person entered the room and the first one rushed off. One hour later, the second person rushed off as well.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of them showed zero interest in me as a candidate, none of them even bothered to get a printed copy of my CV. From the questions they asked me, it was also clear that they didn‚Äôt take a look at it at all.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt make it to the final round but the way they made me feel caused me to doubt my wish to join the company. The only thing that really attracted me was their big name and the possibility to do product design well.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-looking-to-get-free-work-through-designtasks&quot;&gt;4. Looking to get free work through ‚Äúdesign¬†tasks‚Äù&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A designer told me a story about how he recently applied for a job at a cool investment startup but was asked to do not one, but two design tasks. He completed both of them but was turned down. He was told that they wanted the problems solved in a way that would be unusual to them‚Äîwhatever that means. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that startup ended up using some of the work he did for them for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre still asking the designers to do test design tasks to evaluate their capabilities you need to stop. With the little information that you‚Äôll give them, they won‚Äôt be able to come up with a viable solution and you‚Äôre wasting their time. Plenty has been written about this but here‚Äôs a quick recap: the best way to evaluate designers is through an on-site whiteboard challenge where they can interact with other people from the company so they can get the required information to do the job. Acquiring information is a fundamental part of design and by sending a task over email and letting them come up with a solution in isolation is a recipe for disaster. Good design doesn‚Äôt happen in isolation.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-not-involving-other-people-from-thecompany&quot;&gt;5. Not involving other people from the¬†company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world (for designers), everyone is a designer. Everyone knows the basic principles of design and possesses the design common sense (capability of design thinking). But we don‚Äôt live in a perfect world. Designers, once in the intended position, won‚Äôt be talking to other designers alone. They‚Äôll need to communicate with other people like product managers, engineers, marketing etc. So why are you only involving designers in the recruitment/interviewing process? Why aren‚Äôt you including other people that the hired person will have to work with? See if they get along? Give them a task and see if they can collaborate well together?¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers usually get along. It‚Äôs easy to talk about pretty colours and icons or admire well-designed animations and spend a couple of hours doing just that. It‚Äôs easy for us to get along, but for the newly-hired designers to do well, they‚Äôll need to get along with other people too. People that don‚Äôt speak the design language. Involve those people in the recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-lure-designers-in-based-on-falsepromises&quot;&gt;6. Lure designers in based on false¬†promises&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies do this. It‚Äôs easy to lure designers in promising all sorts of cool stuff‚Äîgood salary, ways of working, design-centred culture, whatever makes designers happy. Yes, you‚Äôll get to hire cool designers that know their shit. But after the honeymoon period is over, they‚Äôll want to leave. Those promises you gave at the beginning? Nowhere to be seen. They realised you conned them and they‚Äôll be gone as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt promise a range of salary of $60,000 to $100,000 if you‚Äôre only willing to give $60,000 to pretty much anyone (regardless of their experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt promise them a design-centred culture in the company if you know that there‚Äôs no such thing. Let them know what to expect, the good stuff and the challenges.
I once joined a company that was promising a good range of salary and a great way of working. By the end of the hiring process, I was offered the minimum of the salary range but I still took the job because I was expecting a cool design-centred culture established in the company along with a great way of doing stuff. Do I need to tell you that none of that turned out to be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-little-thingsmatter&quot;&gt;The little things¬†matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as little things matter in design CVs, they matter even more in the recruitment processes. Basic things like: replying to emails, not taking ages to give any sort of feedback and show some respect. Lots of ‚Äúbig name‚Äù companies look for humility in designers but don‚Äôt show any of it on their side. If you‚Äôre looking for humble and honest people, act humble and be honest. There‚Äôs no room for bullshit in the design recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on the design recruitment process? Do you have stories to share?

The gap between designers and developers is still there and I haven‚Äôt seen many projects that are trying to address that. Better Web Type at its core is exactly that‚Äîit starts off explaining typography, how it works, why web developers need to learn about it and then shows them how.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because I never expected it to grow as much as it did, I also didn‚Äôt expect there would eventually be costs to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really expected to make money from the project and I also never expected that it would grow as it did. So far, it has helped more than 15,000 designers and developers understand web typography and‚Äîwhat‚Äôs more important‚Äîenabled them to work together better.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, one of the biggest fans and supporters of my work‚ÄîHarry‚Äîsent me an email after he purchased my book for the second time, this time in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-book&quot;&gt;newly released paperback format&lt;/a&gt; (Harry if you‚Äôre reading, cheers!). He told me how much my work has helped him improve his and sent me a design he was working on. He got everything right: the contrast, the whitespace, the typefaces, the scale, the horizontal rhythm, the vertical rhythm, the punctuation‚Ä¶ everything! It was a textbook execution of all the stuff I wrote about in the Better Web Type¬†book.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two magic moments that happen in the process of starting your own¬†business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you sell your product for the first time and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you realise how helpful it is to the people who buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example I described above was clearly the second of the two. But unlike the first one, the second one can be a repeating event. I keep getting positive emails from people I helped so far.¬†Sometimes people even send me physical mail like postcards, which I find pretty cool. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here‚Äôs my secret:&lt;/strong&gt; yes, it‚Äôs really cool when someone buys the book and I earn a couple of dollars because of that. It helps me cover the costs of running this project plus a little something extra on top‚Äîsomething I can put in my savings. I still get excited every time someone buys the book, just like the first time it happened. But I get even more excited when I receive an email like the one mentioned above. It makes me happy to a point where it brings a tear to my eye. And with every such email I receive, with contrast to the book sale moment, this feeling gets amplified. I feel better about my work when I see how helpful it is to other people. And this is what it‚Äôs all about. It‚Äôs not the what or how, it‚Äôs the why. And my why is simple‚Äîhelp designers and developers understand typography and help them work together better. That‚Äôs it.¬†It really is as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like at the moment, companies take pride in how ‚Äúdata-driven‚Äù they are. It must be a good thing, because big, fancy companies claim to be so. All these companies risk ending up in a tunnel where quantitative tests claim to provide the answers to all questions. But there‚Äôs a reason why there‚Äôs a qualitative way of acquiring feedback. The quantitative tests are good in providing information about the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô, but they usually can‚Äôt give us an answer to the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô. This is exactly where the qualitative side comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

The whole team behind the product is so clueless that they don‚Äôt even know if the new feature brings any value to the users.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We come up with our pity assumptions and hypothesis and we try to validate them. We try to show that we‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre being paid for right? Being smart and all‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre certain we‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ until we‚Äôre proven wrong. Time and time again. But even then, we doubt the validity of the test and we doubt the meaning of a metric if we need to. So we run another A/B test or more user testing sessions. We spend days or even weeks to get a similar result. Another result that we don‚Äôt really know how to interpret. The process feels like making tiny steps in the dark‚Äîexpecting meaningful results by doing the same thing over and over again.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Certainty is the enemy of growth. Nothing is for certain until it has already happened‚Äîand even then, it‚Äôs debatable. That‚Äôs why accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place. Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt‚Ä¶ Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we‚Äôre wrong all the time. Because we are. Being wrong opens up to the possibility of change.&lt;br /&gt;
‚ÄîMark Manson&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our industry is plagued with certainty. Smartass people with thick heads who are certain in their own work because they have been doing it for 10+ years or whatever. I came across many people like that but in a way, we‚Äôre all the same. It‚Äôs our process of creating something and then proving that it‚Äôs correct that is wrong.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-real-life-example&quot;&gt;A real-life example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, we had a discussion at work. If you go to a typical car ad on Auto Trader today, you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs being sold by a ‚ÄúTrade Seller‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A certain group of people inside the company believe that it should be replaced with the actual name of the company selling the car because it would be clearer to the user. I am one of those people. We even had discussions of including that seller information (including their rating) in the search results. So I decided to prove that the ‚ÄúTrade Seller‚Äù bit is confusing the users. I was certain that they don‚Äôt understand what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I devised two tests with Usability Hub in a way that the results could be easily quantified. I mocked up search results with seller rating in two versions: one with ‚ÄúTrade Seller + rating‚Äù and another one with ‚ÄúActual seller name + rating‚Äù. I was looking to answer two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do users understand what the ‚ÄúTrade seller / actual seller name mean‚Äù?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And  do they understand what is the rating next to it referring to?¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, I was certain to prove:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;that people don‚Äôt understand what ‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù means and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that they won‚Äôt understand that the rating is of the seller when placed next to the ‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising and humbling. I did find answers to both questions but they were the complete opposite of what I wanted to prove. The results showed that people do understand what ‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù means. Actually, in the test most of them knew exactly what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs where it gets crazy. Not only did the participants understand what ‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù means. They understood what the rating is of better when it was next to ‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù instead of the actual name of the seller. In the v1 of the test (‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù), 86% of participants knew what it meant and 93% of them said that the rating is of the seller. In the v2, 100% of participants claimed that the names were the car dealerships that were selling the listed cars but only 46% of them said that the rating is of the seller. The rest assumed it was a rating of the car.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wrong-05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I proved myself wrong on both accounts. People know what ‚ÄúTrade seller‚Äù means and they understand that the rating next to it is of the seller and not of the car (I ran the test two times with a total of 40 participants for each version, just to be sure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The A/B test was already planned and ready to go. I had to stop it, so we could first see if users understand the information correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we only found out about that because of the way the test was devised‚Äîqualitative feedback that can be quantified. The initial plan was to simply run a quantitative A/B test and see if it has an effect on our core business metrics. That would never teach us what we learned through this simple test. We couldn‚Äôt interpret the result correctly because we wouldn‚Äôt know if the users even understand the information presented. But the worst part is: we wouldn‚Äôt even know that. We would end up with an uneducated guess and we wouldn‚Äôt even realise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always leave room for uncertainty. Not to the point where we‚Äôre paralysed by it and scared to make a choice. Decide based on the information you have at the moment but question your solution. Assume it‚Äôs wrong and try to prove it‚Äôs wrong. Failing is a better way to learn than running A/B tests to (sometimes falsely) confirm the validity of your solution. Forget your ego and forget your entitlement to be correct. Even if you have been doing this for years. Or maybe especially because of that. Things change, we need to remain humble and admit that we don‚Äôt understand everything and that we make mistakes. But if we admit it, we can learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
