You see, I never specialised in anything. Since I was a child, I had a habit of putting things together and create something out of that. I saw things differently from others. Where everyone else saw a cardboard box, I saw a cool military jeep that I could create out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was different. Or at least, at that point I thought it was. I was studying management and economics at a local university when I turned my hobby into a small business that was enough to get by. I was doing proper UX/UI design work for clients worldwide. Looking back, I now realise I was doing well. But that didn’t mean much to me. People wouldn’t hire me to draw pretty illustrations and they wouldn’t hire me to do front-end development stuff. They hired me to bring their brands to life (yes back then I did that sort of work too) and design their websites. They hired me to design user experiences and do pretty much everything design-related for them—including building and deploying the websites I designed for their projects.  Believe it or not, that only fueled my frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/skills-before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These would be the skills that I had then. Enough of each to get by, but not really specialised in anything. At least that’s how I felt at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;t-shaped-skills&quot;&gt;T-shaped skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, I stumbled upon the “T-shaped skills” concept. I had never heard of anything similar before. Let’s take a look at what exactly it means: &lt;em&gt;Having skills and knowledge that are both deep and broad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I decided to dig deeper and I learned that generalists (people with such skills) are in high demand at some of the best companies. Companies that solve tough problems using the so-called design thinking. That was the first time that I saw my lack of specialism as something that could potentially be good. Looking back now, it seems that at that moment, I made a subconscious decision to become a generalist. A while later it became clear to me that being a generalist is an amazing thing (and that I was a generalist already anyway) so I made a conscious decision to specialise in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/t-shaped-skills.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, generalists don’t necessarily have average skills all around. The name “generalist” tends to imply that but it’s not true. Once I decided to become a proper generalist I decided that UX/UI would be my main skill so I would put most effort into improving that. But being a generalist means that I put a lot of effort into picking up other, complementing skills. Web design, native apps design, visual design, front-end development, design-thinking, prototyping etc. They would all get an equally important part in acquiring and developing skills. And it’s not just acquiring skills for the sake of it. It’s acquiring skills with an intent to use them or in most cases even acquiring skills by using them before acquiring them (learning by doing)—which often requires improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/skills-now.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal changed from naively striving to be the best at everything (and wasting energy and time to get there) to making small and systematic steps towards becoming the &lt;em&gt;most complete designer I can be&lt;/em&gt;. Since I consciously started working on specialising as a generalist, my skills set is more complete. I know that my illustration and animation skills are still quite basic, but so far, they were always good enough. That’s what being a generalist means to me: knowing how to apply the skills you already have and pick up new ones when needed and apply them immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-being-a-generalist-a-goodthing&quot;&gt;Why is being a generalist a good thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People possessing these [broad] skills are able to shape their knowledge to fit the problem at hand rather than insist that their problems appear in a particular, recognizable form. Given their wide experience in applying functional knowledge, they are capable of convergent, synergistic thinking&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about a real-life scenario. We have two teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team A:&lt;/em&gt; Sam is a UX/UI designer with an interest in front-end development and product design/management. Other members of the team are John, a full-stack web developer and Scarlet, a product manager. John has a particular interest in UX and design in general. Scarlet, the product manager, has some UX background and loves doing UX research and customer development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team B:&lt;/em&gt; Allison is a UI designer. She likes to create pretty things and hates when other people make her push pixels around. Emma is a UX designer, she loves creating wireframes and prototypes. She’s comfortable with letting Allison take over from there. Peter is a product manager, he loves coming up with ideas for products and thinks that’s his responsibility. Eric is a full-stack developer as he does both: back- and front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s give our teams a (broad) problem to solve:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Design and build an application to help people who do product development learn new skills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for T-shaped skills surfaces anywhere problem solving is required across different deep functional knowledge bases or at the juncture of such deep knowledge with an application area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Leonard-Barton&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research suggests, that people who have broad skills communicate and work with others better. It makes sense: because Sam from team A knows a bit about front-end development, it’s much easier to talk to web developers and explain what needs to be done. The same goes the other way, John—team A’s full-stack developer knows a bit about design so he can suggest improvements the designer might have missed. Team A is a small squad that has the skills and the mentality required to find out what needs to be built and then go on and build it. Put a good product development process on top of that and the chances of success rise dramatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team B on the other hand, is much more likely to have communication issues. Designers that aren’t comfortable getting feedback early and often can’t function in teams that need to move fast. Product managers that think that coming up with product ideas is solely their responsibility are hard to work with because they hate it when people question their ideas. Allison, the UX designer likes the wireframing and prototyping part but doesn’t have a habit of seeing products through to the end. Eric, the team B’s full-stack developer is the person that comes closest to being a generalist. But it’s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that everyone should aim to become a generalist. There’s room for specialists in product development teams too. But there needs to be the right balance of the two. What I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; saying though is that being a generalist is fun. Having a holistic overview of the product development process and see things through to the end. Making sure that things get built as they were intended and learn how to improve with the next iteration at the same time. I don’t really think it’s just about acquiring and using different skills—It’s a mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched an email course called Better Web Type on 14 February this year. It introduces the topic of typography to people who actually design and build websites—web designers and web developers. Split into 10 daily lessons, it covers topics like rhythm in web typography, how to use modular scales, how to combine typefaces and similar. It was featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/&quot;&gt;CSS-tricks&lt;/a&gt;, as a cover feature in the Net magazine, in the Web Designer magazine, as well as sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-295/&quot;&gt;Codrops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/web-development-reading-list-186/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The course is highly-rated with an average of 4.7 out of 5 after more than 700 reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students that went through the course loved it so much that they started asking for a book. Writing a book on the same topic was always on my roadmap but the high demand turned it into my top priority. The book was released as an eBook on July 31 and is available to &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-book&quot;&gt;order on the Better Web Type website&lt;/a&gt;. A paperback version will follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="books" /><category term="Typography" /><category term="Web-design" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/bwt-cover" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Equilateral triangle of a perfect paragraph</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/articles/2017/06/09/equilateral-triangle-of-a-perfect-paragraph/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Equilateral triangle of a perfect paragraph" /><published>2017-06-09T20:56:54+01:00</published><updated>2017-06-09T20:56:54+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/articles/2017/06/09/equilateral-triangle-of-a-perfect-paragraph</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/articles/2017/06/09/equilateral-triangle-of-a-perfect-paragraph/">&lt;p&gt;And the lack of knowledge about typography doesn’t come from ignorance. I learned that web designers are commonly either self-taught and haven’t grasped the importance of typography yet, or they actually studied design but typography was just one of the classes they had to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com&quot;&gt;Better Web Type&lt;/a&gt; course to help raise awareness of the important role typography plays on the web. In my opinion, both web designers and web developers should learn the basics—if a designer uses ligatures in her designs but the developer doesn’t even know what ligatures are, how can we expect him to correctly transform the most beautifully designed typography into code? With both roles knowing the basics, we’ll be able to start contributing to a better web by producing better web typography. Together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things in typography is to shape a seamless reading experience that invites the reader and presents the content in an objective way. To do that, we need to be able to shape perfect paragraphs. There are three keys to doing that, as Josef Mueller-Brockmann—a renowned 20th-century typographer and visual communicator, put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reader should be able to read the message of a text easily and comfortably. This depends to a not inconsiderable extent on the size of the type, the length of the lines and the leading (line-height).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Josef Mueller–Brockmann&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Equilateral triangle of a perfect paragraph article was originally published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/equilateral-triangle-perfect-paragraph/&quot;&gt;CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt; where you can read the rest. I launched a learning game based on this theory at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/triangle-game.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that as many people as possible come across this game and learn that line-height, font-size, and length of lines always need to be considered together. Try to get the best result and challenge your friends. The more people know about this, the better the web typography will get.&lt;/p&gt;

I use this precious time to do some work on my projects. Sounds dull, but deep down it makes me happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Better Web Type has been on my to-do list for almost two years. Mostly because I didn’t know what to do and where to&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched a project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterwebtype.com&quot;&gt;Better Web Type&lt;/a&gt; in February and my new website shortly after that. Better Web Type is an email course I wanted to do for a while but never really took the time. It required a lot of work and that was one of the reasons why I kept postponing it. Then I learned what are the best ways to move projects forward. It boils down to three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break big problems down into small chunks that are easier to solve,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put a deadline to all these small steps,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have an overview of progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello, for me, plays an essential role in this process. I use it for both, my personal projects and my personal/professional development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-trello-for-personalprojects&quot;&gt;Using Trello for personal projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each project gets its own board in Trello. Each board has four columns: Ideas, To Do, Doing, Done. The ‘Ideas’ column helps me a lot when it comes to quickly putting down, well, ideas. I have the Trello app on my iPhone so I can put something there anytime. Most of my ideas come out of the blue so that’s the best way for me to capture them. If I decide at some point that an idea won’t make it, I simply archive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-01-board.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cards should form a shape of a “bridge”. I always try to keep only one card in To Do and Doing columns.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The cards should form a shape of a “bridge”. I always try to keep only one card in To Do and Doing columns. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to making a Kan Ban system (which Trello in its essence is) work, is to keep things moving and staying lean. Don’t have too many things in the ‘To Do’ and ‘Doing’ columns. If something gets stuck in there it needs to get unstuck and moved forwards (or in some cases even backwards). I always try to have only one item in each of those columns. This way I can see what I’m working on at the moment and what’s the thing that comes next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro tip: if an item is stuck in one of these two columns for too long but you’re not sure why, try to break it down into smaller tasks. Move some of them backwards if necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last is the ‘Done’ column. It seems completely unnecessary to have that column there at first. But what I found out is that it helps with motivation. When there’s hard things that need to be done and you’re starting to despair, a list, full of tasks that were already completed show that you really can do anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-trello-for-personalprofessional-development&quot;&gt;Using Trello for personal/professional development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how an where to draw the line between the personal and professional development. Almost everything I do in free time helps with my professional development and I enjoy doing what I do anyway. I guess it’s the same question as when it comes to work/life balance. It’s not even a question when work is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-02-planning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My ‘Planning’ board is made of short term (ST) and long term (LT) plans cards.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My ‘Planning’ board is made of short term (ST) and long term (LT) plans cards. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the basic—To Do, Doing and Done columns for this. The trick here is that I have two types of cards. One for long term and one for short, long term for a year and short for the current quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term card gets a name like ‘LT—2017’ and it’s there that I write down the things that I want to do in the current year, broken down into quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-03-card.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My LT plan card consists of a broad plan for the current year, split into quarters.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My LT plan card consists of a broad plan for the current year, split into quarters. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description is then followed by a number of checklists. Ticking things in these lists helps me with motivation again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short term card is more detailed. It has checklists for things I want to read, projects I want to do, articles and newsletters I want to write and skills I want to work on in the current quarter. For example, in this quarter (April–June), I want to read five books, work on various Better Web Type projects and write a couple of articles. This newsletter is also in the list of things I planned for this quarter. As you see in the screenshot, there’s no skills that I plan working on in this quarter. In the past I had things like completing the React.js and Python courses there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-04-card-details.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The short term card is mostly made of checklists of things I want to do in the upcoming 3 months.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The short term card is mostly made of checklists of things I want to do in the upcoming 3 months. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-thingsforward&quot;&gt;Moving things forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing in completing projects is moving things forward. As I said, Trello plays a key role in that for me but Trello alone isn’t enough. I figured that out a while ago. I had things broken down into small steps and planned but kept failing at actually completing them. Then I found out how important it is to 1. have a deadline for every small thing in the ‘To Do’ list and 2. have a constant overview over the progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things help me with this. At work, I have a small notebook where I write down the todos for each week. Every morning when I come in I check that list and decide what I’ll work on that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-05-notebook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My to dos for the week 13.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My to dos for the week 13. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I have a whiteboard where I do a similar thing. I have a weekly to do list but I also write down all the small steps that need to be done for a project and put a date next to them. It’s not so much about meeting the deadline. It’s more about putting a sense of urgency to the tasks. Urgency that is commonly not there when we work on personal projects. A deadline will push you to do things, even if you have to move it for a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trello-06-whiteboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The whiteboard wall at home keeps reminding me of things that need to be done, by when and motivates me at the same time.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The whiteboard wall at home keeps reminding me of things that need to be done, by when and motivates me at the same time. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you noticed it but I don’t have deadlines next to my tasks in the notebook at work. That’s exactly because of that sense of urgency. There’s no lack of that at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overview of the progress is essential. Before, I had these tasks written down in Trello but it was so easy to forget about them. Now I have them where I can’t miss them. I check the notepad at work every day and I can’t not see the big whiteboard I have at home. These help me remind of things that need to be done everyday and motivates me when I see things that have already been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it work with Trello? I usually have the top-level description of the task in Trello and the small steps required to complete it on my whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-thingsdone&quot;&gt;Getting things done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really happy that I managed to perfect my working process like that. It took me a while to figure it out but now I’m finally in a place where I manage to get my personal projects through the door. They’re not just an idea I want to work on at some time.

They swore to themselves never to let their guard down after Rome was sacked by the Gauls in its early history. Because of that, they developed a highly organised, professional war machine. They conquered whatever they set their sights on. And they remained hungry — after each conquest they already had plans for the next one. At their peak, the Romans controlled the region between the frozen Scottish highlands in the north and the sandy deserts of north Africa in the south. But then — they stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emperor Hadrian decided to put up walls to “protect the empire”. His decision meant that he was happy with what he had. Protecting his lands became more important than conquering new ones. It was a drastic shift in mentality. A mentality that Romans never adopted before. Until then, they were always on the offensive, expanding further into unknown. The more they conquered, the more resources they had to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, all of a sudden, they decided to put this war machine on hold. They put their legions on the walls where, for most of the time, they waited. The most effective army in the world was put on a defensive. They couldn’t use their skills so often anymore and they didn’t have to learn new ones to overcome new obstacles. The decline of the army started. The sharp swords got dull. The tactics were forgotten. A few generations later, it was nowhere near the might of the early empire. The downfall had started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-put-up-a-wall-draw-aline&quot;&gt;Don’t put up a wall, draw a line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can learn from this story is that we should never put up our walls. We should never draw the line and be happy with what we have. I don’t mean that in a materialistic way. Money and materialism are the worst things to drive someone forward. Look beyond that and see what you want to achieve. Are you looking for knowledge to satisfy your hunger of curiosity? Are you looking to pick up skills that will always keep you sharp — in step with time? The moment you put up that wall will be the moment of the start of your decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put up a wall once. I was in the middle of transitioning from web design to UI &amp;amp; visual design and I thought to myself: it’s my job to make this look nice, I don’t want to worry about coding it. That’s developer’s job. I was happy with my UI &amp;amp; visual design skills so I put up a wall around them. My ignorance turned into fear. Fear of code and anything about it. I had basic web design skills from before but started neglecting them. JavaScript was what I dreaded the most. I had always relied on my brother, who’s a full stack developer, whenever I needed anything done in Javascript or jQuery. Even if it was a simple animated scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then one day, out of the blue, I decided it was time to change. I tore that wall down. It happened in an instant. I decided that my skills weren’t good enough as they were. I finally decided to face my fear. I started learning JavaScript. I completed the course on Codecademy. I read a book. I started coding and exploring what I can do with my newly acquired skill. I conquered my fear. I broke trough the wall and the only thing that I had on my mind was: “okay, what’s next?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through conquering that fear, I rediscovered my hunger. My curiosity. My mind shifted. Now I feel like there’s nothing that I can’t do. The opposite. I can do anything I put my mind to. It may need more time at first but I will do it. Now I don’t put up walls anymore. I draw lines. These lines don’t represent the current state. They don’t represent something that I’m happy with. They represent a point in the future. They represents skills I want to acquire, products I want to build and the person I want to be. Lines can be moved. Walls can’t.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html">And that’s alright because that was a huge part of their empire.

How they aren’t meant to give final answers. They’re meant to ask further questions. To doubt your own solutions. And with that comes a lot more sketching. Sketching is not something you do at the start of the process, produce a wonderful looking sketch and move on. Sketching needs to be done throughout the design process. And in order to produce more sketches quicker, the quality of sketching needs to move aside. Here’s quick overview of my sketching kit followed by a few tips to make sketching serve its true meaning in your design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;My sketch kit: A Schneider Topliner 967, a Sharpie and a shader. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;start-with-a-sharpie&quot;&gt;Start with a sharpie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some designers will use a pencil to start drawing their early sketches. They do so because their ideas aren’t clear yet. So they draw an interface, see it’s not right, erase parts of it and draw them again. This is a great way to start spending too much time on one sketch only and start thinking about details way too early. My recommendation is don’t use a pencil and an eraser. Use a sharpie instead. Or something similar, as long as the tip of the pen is thick and will produce thick lines. This will force you to not focus on details and to make mistakes. Mistakes that you can’t erase. So to fix a mistake you have to draw a new version of the sketch. I know, you’re probably thinking: “but that’s a waste of time!” Here’s the tricky part. These early sketches should be so simple that it takes you very little time to produce. By little time I mean less than a minute. If it’s not the right solution you just discard it without feeling sorry for wasting effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, it’s important that you try to explore different ideas, solutions, combinations of different UI elements and interactions. Once you have that in front of you, you’ll start seeing patterns and connections that you couldn’t see before. You might want to try and combine a few sketches into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro tip: try to sketch on a large canvas like a big paper, a whiteboard or a even a wall. Don’t use a small notepad. This will make you even faster and you’ll have a nice overview of your progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/early-sketches.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A total of 6 different sketches were explored in this particular process (as seen here with my notes on stickies).&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;converge-and-add-some-details&quot;&gt;Converge and add (some) details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be more comfortable with what you produced through sketching at this point. You’ve explored different ideas, layouts, UI elements… You might have combined some of them already and there’s probably a version of the sketch or two that you think might be the right ones. But there’s still lots of questions. It’s time to draw a bit more detailed sketches. Here’s where my Schindler and shader pens come in. The title that was just a wavy line before now becomes actual text. The paragraphs are still wavy lines. The UI elements become more detailed as well. The button is not just a dark box, it’s a box with text and some shading. You might even add some (basic) representations of icons at this point. It’s ok to spend more time on these sketches. It’s ok because you’ve already answered a lot of questions. At this point, the only way to start answering more questions is to add details. And it’s ok to do so because you narrowed down your solution to one or two sketches earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/final-sketch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final result with a bit more details and shading. Still not a pretty sketch, but it does the job.&quot; /&gt;

I always loved to sketch, scribble and draw. I always felt this need to put something on the paper. Something visual I can refer to later on. Something I put out of my head—an idea that gets transformed into something physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a particular time when I was looking for some inspiration and stumbled upon this sketch. The effect it had on me was the opposite of what I was looking for. It didn’t inspire me. It demotivated me. My sketches were never made of straight lines, shading and nice depictions of people, maps and UI elements. My sketches were ugly, with lots of corrections, lines that were too long, boxes that were too small. If someone took a look at them they wouldn’t be able to understand a thing without my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketches-arent-supposed-to-be-perfect&quot;&gt;Sketches aren’t supposed to be perfect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s the thing about sketches. There’s a secret that not a lot of designers know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;floatRight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental thing about sketching is that it is about asking not telling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt;—&amp;hairsp;Bill Buxton&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your sketches don’t have to tell anything to anyone else but yourself. Even then, they’re merely a tool to ask further questions. By asking further questions we get to asking the right questions. Eventually. And only if you ask yourself enough questions. This means, a lot of sketching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of sketching is not to do a perfect sketch that looks awesome. It’s not for sharing information with others. It’s for putting an idea to the paper. For me personally, it’s one of the three magic moments in the design process. By drawing one sketch that looks more like a drawing, designers miss the main purpose of sketching. To depict an idea as it is currently in your head—with all the holes that represent the missing information. By drawing as many sketches as possible and putting as many ideas from your head to paper we get in the right mindset and start to discover the missing parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you want to sketch something, don’t pay any attention to what your sketch looks like. Instead, try to produce as many as possible—different ideas, multiple possible solutions our different combinations of UI elements. Your job shouldn’t be assessed based on your sketches. It’s the final product that we need to focus on. You sketches need to be something that you can throw away if it’s not what you need. It’s something that you spend minutes drawing instead of hours. It’s something that will take you from a cloud of ideas to a functioning product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might even argue that sketching is a complete waste of time and should be skipped altogether. It either takes too long or it’s done very quickly. Both arguments serve as a good excuse to do so. I mentioned earlier that I think sketching is one of the three magic moments in the design process (I’ll write about these at some time). Sketching is the most important one. Your idea takes form for the first time and makes everything clearer. It’s not a perfect representation of what you want to do but this is where the magic of sketching lies. They can, should and will change through time. The quicker they change, the better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="UX" /><category term="Design" /><summary type="html">This means that I started to sketch a lot more.

It was the resignation letter. I had no choice but sign it. I had skipped way too many classes. I went over the limit and this was the next step in the process. But it wasn’t just about skipping classes. I wasn’t doing well at school at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was surprised by how my first years of high school went. Until then I never had problems in school. In fact, school never really posed a challenge to me. All I needed to do to get trough the year was a minimal effort. The first year of high school followed a similar fashion. No major problems, completed with minimal effort. Some trouble would arise occasionally but nothing too serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class teacher figured me out though. She noticed that I’m not investing enough time in school matters and that I could be doing a lot better if I did. Soon she would start to label me as lazy. She literally called me “lazy boy” (she taught English). She did that publicly. Maybe it was her way of trying to wake me up and motivate me. Well, it didn’t work. Quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matej-is-clever-butlazy&quot;&gt;Matej is clever but lazy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being publicly labeled as lazy made things worse. My schoolmates treated me as such and other teachers as well. “Matej is clever but he’s lazy” is what they would say about me. And that triggered the opposite effect of what they wanted to achieve. It made me care about school even less. I had less problems with skipping classes. I eventually failed a year and dropped out soon after that. I was already perceived as a failure so why not act as one as well? It may sound stupid but that’s how people work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an experiment conducted in India. The students from different castes had to take a test. They were split into two groups—one that had to publicly tell what caste they’re from and another where the students didn’t have to do that. The students from the lower castes in the first group performed worse than the students from the higher caste but their lower caste colleagues performed the same as the ones from the higher caste in the other group. This means that the lower caste students that had to publicly disclose their caste subconsciously felt that they had to perform worse than the ones from the higher caste so they did. We are not who we think we are. We are what the environment and the society we live in dictate us to be. You can read more about the experiment here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing with me was… I wasn’t lazy at all. I just didn’t care enough. I preferred playing video games day in day out. Red Alert 2, Half-Life, Quake 3 Arena… you name it, I played it. The time I skipped an annoying class to go home early with a bag of candy and play video games was the time of my life. Besides, when I wasn’t playing video games I was coding and designing websites. More for fun than anything else but as it turned out, it was these skills that took me places, not the ones I learned in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not who you think you are. I am not who I think I am. We are defined by so many factors and the society is a large part of it. But if we acknowledge that, we might be able to regain our identities. Maybe just a small part. So… who are you?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Psychology" /><category term="Design" /><summary type="html">“Sign here and you’ll resign from the technical high school”, said the headmaster as he gave me a disappointed look.

  &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses” is a quote attributed to Henry Ford. It’s a quote that many people use as an excuse not to do user testing. Because designers and product managers are supposed to be these geniuses that pull ideas out of thin air. Steve Jobs was one of those design/product gurus. All the designer and product manager wannabes have a quote or two from Steve that they hold close to their heart so they feel more secure about themselves. But neither Steve or Henry became famous for their ideas because they would be original. They weren’t. Steve didn’t make the first computer and Henry didn’t make the first car (he made the first car assembly line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone quotes one of these guys, they try to convince other people in the room that it’s a designer’s job to know what the users want and need. But if there’s no research and no interaction with (potential) customers, how is a designer supposed to know that? It’s not that designers design products for themselves. And if they do, they’re probably not that good at designing anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very recent case where we were working on redesigning a product at Auto Trader we conducted some quick user testing with the people from our company. Some people suggested not to do that because the quality of the feedback will be low. They’re too invested in the product and know too much about it. Supposedly. We went on and did some testing anyway. We told them what the scenario was and what we want them to do. We were testing the UX of the new product and the UIs of some of the screens that were redesigned. A basic clickable wireframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of research done before we started working on redesigning the product and we didn’t expect to learn much. We were looking for a validation of what we had. But the people that we tested with started coming up with questions. “How do I buy a new car from this page?”, “Where can I see how long the car dealer has been in business?” etc. This were the questions that people haven’t asked until that point. We then explored why they were asking these questions and quickly went back to the drawing board. We updated the clickable wireframe and tested with a few more people. They had the same questions but this time they found the answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t know what they want. That’s true. But they’ll know when something is missing. And you don’t want your product to be a bunch of features that completely miss what users want to do. Designers don’t know what people want. It’s not your job as a designer to know that by default. But it is your job to find out. If you’re designing for them, you have to know what their motivations are. Period. It’s not about the faster horses. It’s about the whys behind the faster horses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Design" /><summary type="html">“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses” is a quote attributed to Henry Ford.

Working hard on something but not getting anywhere with it. Through all these years I found three approaches that help me through these moments. Most of the times they work. But sometimes they don’t and I ship average work, feel bad about it and can’t wait to get back and improve it. Anyway, here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;force-my-way-through-with-hard-work&quot;&gt;Force my way through with hard work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have I spent hours of work on a project that needed to be done yesterday but still wasn’t going anywhere. The feeling of frustration grows until you’re fed up and need a break. I usually do take a break but a short one. The work needs to be done in a few hours and there’s nothing left but force my way through. A few hours of hard work after already a few hours of hard work is incredibly tough. But sometimes it’s all that is left. It may produce above average work at best but it will be done. It’s important to leave your perfectionism out of it when you need to take this approach. Momentum is the other important part. Don’t take long breaks. Take more shorter ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-on-something-else&quot;&gt;Work on something else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach will only work if you have the luxury to postpone the work for a little while. Working on one thing for hours will narrow your focus and you won’t be able to see the big picture anymore. You might also need a different perspective on the work but after hours spent on it, you’re too heavily invested. You need to get away from the work and work on something else for a while. Spend an hour or even less trying to find a solution to another problem, then get back to the original task. You’ll fell slightly refreshed and more eager to continue the work. Smaller tasks are the best for intermediate shift of focus. Try to complete at least a few to motivate you even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep-on-it&quot;&gt;Sleep on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last approach is not for the rushed projects that need to be done on the same day. This will only work if you can get back to work on another day but might be the most effective. Our subconscious mind is more effective at finding patterns than the conscious one. After spending hours of hard work on a problem your brain will do you a favour of trying to find a solution while you sleep. That’s why it’s much better to study for an exam before you go to sleep, not in the morning just before the exam (tell that to the young version of me). You’ll have a better picture of the problem you’re trying to solve and sometimes even a solution. This approach is great for tougher problems that need time. Others use this approach quite effectively as well. The key is that you need to spend a few hours working hard on the problem. Maybe just before you go to sleep as well. Then let your brain do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matej Latin</name></author><category term="personal-notes" /><category term="Productivity" /><summary type="html">I’m sure you know these moments too.
